// A browser check of the galaxy map (galaxy/HoloMap.jsx, labelPlace.js, mapView.js, useMapView.js, mapKeys.js). With the dev
// server up (npx vite --port 5188 --host 127.0.0.1, or BASE= for another):
//   BASE=http://127.0.0.1:5188 OUT=/tmp/map node scripts/galaxy-map-check.mjs
// It starts nothing itself. Opens #/galaxy, flies the X-wing, presses M, and at 1440x900, 1280x720 and 390x844 (the suite,
// galaxy-map-check/suite.mjs) and then at phone widths (phone.mjs: 375x667 with the side panel, 375x667, 390x844 and 360x640 with
// a touch screen's zoom buttons, 360x640). Shared parts are in galaxy-map-check/lib.mjs, the controls' checks (the find, Escape,
// double clicks, the picked system's marks) in controls.mjs.
//   names: no two system names meet, none is out of the map, none is over another system's dot (whole, zoomed in twice over Hoth,
//     framed on Endor; on a desktop window none at all, on a phone a graze of up to 5 px, each listed: Hoth's, Bespin's, Mustafar's
//     and Nevarro's dots are a few px apart and no place round Bespin's is clear at 360 px); none is under the strip's board, the
//     layers, the key chip or the zoom buttons (at the whole map, at every width), or the course's tag (framed on Endor); nothing a
//     player reads is under 0.7 rem (11.2 px; the SVG's text by its rendered size); the strip, layers, key and zoom buttons clear
//     of one another
//   easing: through a + and a - zoom no name changes size on any frame (the stage and the counter-scale ease together); with
//     reduced motion nothing is eased
//   header: the title, era chips, Films, find and close buttons meet nowhere and sit inside the frame; the Films panel, a popover
//     that may cover the map's controls while open, is shut by a press on the map outside it, the zoom buttons pressable again
//   find: "endo" + Enter picks Endor and has it on view; J then jumps; a YOU tag on the system you're at; the list is plain buttons
//     (no listbox or option roles), says "No system called" for none, and is shut by Escape (which empties the field), a press
//     outside it and Tab out of it (controls.mjs)
//   zoom: the wheel zooms about the pointer, + - 0, a drag (pressed on a system's button, checked) pans and never picks the
//     system it starts on or ends over; Tab through the systems zoomed in keeps the box from scrolling and brings each one into
//     view at the zoom the map has; the cursor is a grab only once zoomed; the whole-galaxy button is aria-disabled, not
//     disabled, and keeps the focus
//   pick: the picked system has a ring and a brighter dot, and the panel's details read "More about <name>"; the second press of a
//     double click landing on another system picks it and starts no jump
//   panels: the layers (and the chip on a phone), the era chips dim what isn't of the era, the films' panel (Escape shuts it,
//     not the map), the key (a wheel over it scrolls it and not the page behind; on a phone it sits under the zoom row), the side
//     panel's wheel, the hover card staying inside the map, the side panel on a short phone still showing the jump
//   phone: the zoom buttons a row in the top right corner (36 px; on touch 44 over a 337 px map, 40 over 327, else 36), clear of
//     the strip's title and the names
//   keys: M (held, too) and Escape close it, / finds; Escape shuts the innermost open thing first: the find's list, the films' panel,
//     the key, a phone's layers, and then the map; a film's pick leaves the focus on the Films chip
//   sharp: zoomed in to k=3.4, the stage is as sharp as without will-change
// Prints a line per check, ok or FAIL, and exits 1 on any FAIL. Shots are in OUT (map-<size>-<what>.png).
