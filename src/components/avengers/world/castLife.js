// What the compound's people are doing from moment to moment: Thor by
// Mjolnir's crater, Natasha at the front door, the Hulk outside the lab and
// the training bot at the training center. Left to themselves they stand a
// while and then train, each in their own way (Thor curls and squats,
// Natasha works the bag and her jab, the Hulk does push-ups, the bot leads
// jumping jacks), now and then doing something of their own (Thor looks to
// the sky, Natasha drops into her stance, the Hulk stamps). When Spider-Man
// comes up on foot they stop, turn to him and greet him, then watch him,
// their heads following him; while their bubble's up they say each line
// with its own gesture, for as long as the line takes; the first time
// they see him after he's won their game they celebrate it. A hard landing
// beside them gets a reaction, and the Space Stone's portal opening over
// the helipad turns their heads. The body (./castBody.js, or the HQ kit's
// figure) shows it; nothing here changes where they stand, what they say
// or when (rules.js's CAST and CompoundWorld's bubbles decide that).
//
// Pure: no three.js, no Math.random (every pick from the seed).
//
//   LIFE: { [cast id]: { train: [{ clip, for: [lo, hi], busy? }], fidgets,
//     greet, won, land, talk, lines: [a clip per CAST line], after: [a clip
//     per line once its game is won] } }   busy: too taken up with it to
//     greet him until he's right there (BUSY_R)
//   createCastLife(member, { seed }) → { step(dt, ctx) → body, event(type, data) }
//     member: a CAST row. ctx: { t, hero: { x, z, low }, say (the line its
//     bubble shows, else null), won (its game won), ended (a one-shot the
//     body has played through, this frame) }. low: on the ground (he's
//     greeted on foot, watched going by in the air)
//     body: { state, clip, loop, once, face, look, fade }: face its yaw (the
//     scene's: c.face + π/2 at rest), look 'hero' | 'portal' | null
//     event('land', { x, z, impact }) | event('portal')
//   lineTime(line) → the seconds a line takes to say
