// A town of Middle-earth on baked floor light (lib/three/groundwork, after

// `terrain` the floor (a mesh, or several: a city's streets with its land);
// `height(x, z)` the floor's height for the blobs (null: as baked);
// `people` [{ object, size }] or [object] (a figure 0.84 m across);
// `centre` [x, z] and `radius` the part of the town that's baked (the play
// space, with room for what shadows its edge; a null radius: the floor's own
// extent, at most 240 m a side); `clip` for one zone of a town shown a zone at
// a time (lib/three/groundwork).
