// The Rick and Morty pages’ look outside their worlds (components/worlds/
// looks.js): the cruiser flying down the page (./cruiser3d.js), the galaxy
// behind it (./GalaxyBackdrop.jsx) and the planets. Painted, as the worlds
// are: the show’s flat colours, toon-shaded and inked; the palette the
// cruiser’s and the backdrop’s. Each is a small renderer of its own with no
// tone mapper and no bloom: its colours are written as they are to be seen,
// over the page.
