// Portal panic’s look (components/worlds/looks.js): painted. The show’s flat
// colours on a toon ramp with ink (./toon.js), each dimension its own sky
// and ground (Portal3D.js’s DIMS); the palette is the cast’s and the
// arenas’ own. The house tone (Neutral, through houseOn). Its bloom is under
// white: the shots, the portals and the bursts are the light of a small
// arena seen from high up.
