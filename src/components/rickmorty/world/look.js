// C-137’s world’s look (components/worlds/looks.js): painted. The show’s
// flat colours on a toon ramp with ink (../portal/toon.js) are its art; the
// palette is the kit’s own (./kit.js: the walls, the floors, the wood, the
// metal, the glass, the portal’s green), and Morty’s and Rick’s clothes
// from the wardrobe (../wardrobe/) are the one mixed thing, on purpose.
// The house tone (Neutral, through lib/stage3d): the exposure was tuned
// under it.
//
// One folder, three scenes, each with its own bloom (BLOOMS): the street
// and the rooms (LOOK’s), Roy’s life (a touch lower: its stage lights and
// its confetti), and the sewer’s run, whose laser, screws and slime glow
// under white on purpose, the drain being dark.
