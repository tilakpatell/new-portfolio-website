// The lock-on in C-137 (lib/combat/lockOn.js on this world's things),
// beside RmWorld.jsx, which is past its size. The Lock button (touch) and
// Tab toggle it; on a coarse pointer it's on by itself while a duel's
// hunter is within 14 m (Total Rickall's crowd aren't hostile: there it's
// only by hand). While it's on:
//   - in Total Rickall the camera stays on whoever was in the sights when
//     it came on (the sight line, rickall.js's, turned onto them as Morty
//     walks), till they're shot;
//   - in a duel Morty turns to face the hunter, so his shots (along his
//     facing, duel.js) go at him.
//
//   stepRmLockOn(lock, s, dt, { R, hunter }) — `lock` a createLockOn, `s`
//   RmWorld's sim (m, yaw, pitch, rickall), `R` Total Rickall's rules (or
//   null before they're loaded), `hunter` the duel's hunter as a bolt body
//   (npc.js's bodies()[0]) or null. Changes s.yaw, s.m.face and s.lockId.
