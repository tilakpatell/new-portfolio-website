// The Citadel of Ricks as modelled for the site (Meshy, Phase 3 of the Rick
// and Morty multiverse: the show's brass disc and teal dome, four arms out to
// glass saucers, the crystal hanging under it), which takes over from the one
// deepspace.js builds once it's loaded. It's fitted to that one's frame: as
// wide as the built dome across its middle, turned so its arms lie along
// deep.js's CITADEL_PARTS (which the siege and the ship's collisions use),
// its disc where the dome's is. Lit as deepspace's own models are: Lambert,
// its colour glowing a little so its far side isn't black.
//
//   citadelModel(group, k, owned) → Promise<boolean> (true once it's in `group`)
