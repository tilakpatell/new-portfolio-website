// The map has sectors: the main one (all of the above, round the origin)
// and the Rick and Morty sector, a region of space of its own far past the
// main map's rim (SECTORS.rickmorty.origin), with the Citadel at its middle
// (deep.js) and the show's worlds (universes.js's MOONS) on a spiral of its
// own round it, a thousand and more units apart. Everything stays on plain
// map coordinates (a sector's body is its origin plus where it sits in it),
// so flight, landings and the autopilot work the same anywhere; what's
// per-sector is the edge the ship's turned back at (ship.js) and the chart.
