// The crews' ship powers in a battle (battle.js's): Force Focus's slowed
// clock, a ghost its fire flies through and Walt's magnet holding the other
// side's fighters. Pure (no three.js), so it's tested in Node; the galaxy's
// war (galaxy/warfront.js) steps its battle through stepBattle, and the
// galaxy's powers (galaxy/powers.js) hold fighters with holdFighters and
// land their own shots through the battle's own hit() (shipPowers.js's
// shotAt), so a power's damage on a battle is a shot's: its objectives'
// shared tally, its shields and its aces all as the guns find them.
//
// It works only through what a battle shows outside (its fighters' pos,
// prev, vel, cool and team, its clock, its you, update and hit), which
// battleScene.js draws from too, so it's the same however battle.js fights
// it inside. The one thing battle.js reads back is `ghost`, while a step
// runs: its bolts fly on past you.
//
//   stepBattle(b, dt, you, { slow, ghost, magnet, pull }) → events (update's)
//   holdFighters(b, at, r, secs, daze) → how many it holds

//   its fighters, its bolts and its batteries, but its clock put on to the
//   real time after (the defender wins on the clock: a power can't stretch
//   it). Your speed as it reckons it is then quicker by the same share,
//   which in its slowed time it is, so its fighters still lead you right.
// - ghost (Han's corkscrew, Rick's portal): its fire flies through you.
// - magnet (Walt's, a point; `pull` the most it drags at): the fighters it
//   holds dragged to it whatever their own flying would have them do. With
//   no magnet, they're let go.
