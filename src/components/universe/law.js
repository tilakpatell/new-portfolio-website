// The law on the map: wanted.js's chase, played out with the scene's own
// hunters and traffic. What you do is a crime if it's one (wanted.js's
// CRIMES), seen by the law if one of theirs is near (a patrol going past,
// or the cops already on you), else by the ordinary ships near enough to
// witness it, whose report runs while any of them is still near. Stars send
// the side's police (sides.js `police`) as wanted.js's RESPONSE says, at
// the difficulty's skill and better; they see you while one of them is
// near and nothing's between you, and once the stars go they leave. A
// bounty brings bounty hunters (by wanted.js's bountyTier) while there are
// no stars on you; landing somewhere pays it off out of the wallet. No
// three.js, so it's tested in Node against stand-ins for the scene's
// hunters and traffic.
