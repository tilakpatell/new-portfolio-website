// The universe map's neighbourhoods. Pure numbers, tested in Node:
// waypoints.js sits its beacons at their hubs, the director (where you are)
// and the roster (“Universe · Near Middle-earth”) read them.
//
// Since the spread (scale.js's SPREAD) the places sit 3,000 to 10,000 apart,
// evenly over the disc: the fandoms on a golden-angle spiral and the wonders
// between them. There are no natural clusters in that, so linking places
// closer than a distance (single linkage) gives a region per place at any
// distance short of one that chains half the map together. Instead the
// places are grouped by complete linkage: the two groups whose furthest
// members are nearest merge, again and again, until REGION_COUNT are left.
// That keeps each region compact (nothing in it far from the rest) and the
// count fixed, whatever moves on the map.
//
// Each region has a hub, its beacon: the middle of its members weighted by
// how far each reaches (the big ones pull it), lifted HUB_LIFT off the disc
// (up and down by turns), and
// pushed straight out of anything it lands in (the Veil is 700 across; a
// sun's planets reach further). The home system is a region of its own, its
// beacon just past its edge on the side the ship starts.
//
// regionAt(x, y, z) says which region a point is in: the region of the
// nearest member within LINK of it (past that member's own reach), or null
// out in the void between them.
