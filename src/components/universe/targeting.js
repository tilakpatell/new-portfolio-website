// Targeting, for the ship on the universe map: which hunter the guns are
// locked on, where to shoot to hit it, how much a shot is helped onto it,
// whether a shot touched it, and where a thing off the edge of the screen is
// pointed to from. Pure (no three.js), so it's tested in Node; scene.js
// reads the ship, the hunters and the camera and draws the brackets
// (UniverseMap.jsx's HUD).
//
// A lock picks itself up: the hunter nearest the nose, within AIM.cone and
// AIM.range (one coming at you counts as nearer), and holds while it stays
// within the wider AIM.hold (a dogfight swings about), dropping once it's
// been outside that for AIM.lose seconds (AIM.loseManual for one picked by
// hand: T, Shift+T or a tap). When its target goes down the guns move
// straight on to the next one inside the hold, so a fight flows; and a lock
// the guns picked themselves gives way when its target has sat wide of the
// nose (outside the pick-up cone) or out of the bolts' reach for AIM.swap
// seconds while another is squarely ahead: they don't stay on one flying
// off while the next comes down your throat. (One picked by hand never
// gives way like that.) The lead
// point is where a bolt fired now meets the target, allowing for its speed
// and the bolt's (the bolts are quick, well over twice the fastest hunter,
// so the lead stays a modest angle off); the pip sits there, and a shot
// within AIM.assist of it bends onto it (so the guns feel like a fighter's,
// not a pea shooter), with the help fading to nothing by AIM.assistEdge,
// a little more forgiving up and down than side to side, all of it scaled
// by the visitor's aim-assist setting. A hit is tested over the whole frame
// with both the bolt and the target moving (sweptHit), so nothing fast
// slips between two frames.
//
// And the nose follows the lock (trackNudge): with a lead point inside
// AIM.trackCone, the stick gets a nudge toward it, at most AIM.trackMax of
// full stick, growing with the angle off (AIM.trackGain), fading to nothing
// at the cone's edge, in the ship's own frame (a target above a ship rolled
// on its side is a turn), and giving way to the pilot's own stick as far as
// it pushes the other way at all; the visitor's lock-tracking setting
// scales it.
// The fighters' pace is hunterRules.js's (they fly the fight at a little
// over your speed), so between the two a fight can be followed.
//
// Points are { x, y, z } (the ship, a Vector3) or [x, y, z] (the map's
// places), in the map's own space.
