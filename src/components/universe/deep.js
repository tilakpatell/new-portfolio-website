// them it's open: the ship's boost becomes a pulse drive, the ceiling lifts
// from the home system's 100 to DEEP.ceiling, and the edge of the map is
// DEEP.edge away. Near any place (the home system, a planet, a wonder) the
// drive drops back to the boost, so you arrive at flying speed. Among the
// planets are the wonders: a ringed gas giant and an ice giant, two other
// suns with planets of their own, a black hole, two nebulae to fly through,
// and the Citadel of Ricks. Everything but the nebulae is solid: graze it and
// you bounce off, hit it fast and you crash (and crash.js and the scene make
// something of it: the Citadel takes you to its world). The black hole is
// the exception: touch it at any speed and it has you, and you don't come
// back. What's on its far side (`beyond`) is a friend's universe, their own
// site, and the page goes on to it (Universe.jsx).
