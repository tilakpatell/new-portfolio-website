// The director: now and then, while you fly, something happens. Pure (no
// three.js), so it's tested in Node; the scene plays each one out.
//
// What can happen depends on whose universe you fly in (the crew's side,
// sides.js: each event `needs` something of the side, or nothing):
// - hunt: a pack of hunters comes after you (the Empire for Luke and Han,
//   the Galactic Federation for Rick, the DEA or the cartel for Walt)
// - destroyer (Star Wars): a Star Destroyer drops out of hyperspace nearby
//   and launches its TIE fighters at you
// - council (Rick and Morty): portals open round you and the Council of
//   Ricks comes through, in their own cruisers, for their Rick
// - roadblock (Breaking Bad): the DEA drops in across your bows and holds
//   you there
// - distress: someone ordinary under attack (a Rebel transport and TIEs, a
//   family saucer and Gromflomites), yours to save or not
// - convoy: a line of freighters under escort goes by
// - comet: a comet crosses the sky
// - supernova: a star blows, far out, the flash seen from anywhere
// - flare: the nearest star flares, and its shockwave reaches you a few
//   seconds later (the shields take a knock, the HUD scrambles)
// - rift: a rift tears open ahead of you; fly into it and it takes you
//   somewhere else on the map (nav.js's riftExit)
// - leviathan: something enormous passes: a pod of purrgil (Star Wars) or
//   a Cromulon with something to say (Rick and Morty)
// - meteors: a stream of rocks crosses your path (meteors.js): shoot them
//   or steer round them
// - bounty: a bounty hunter comes for you alone, tough and quick (Boba Fett
//   in Slave I, Phoenixperson, or the Cousins: sides.js)
// - remover (Rick and Morty): the Galactic Federation's NX-5 Planet Remover
//   drops out of warp over the planet you're at and charges its cannon:
//   knock it out before it fires, or the planet's gone for a minute
//   (remover.js)
// - minefield: a band of mines across your way ahead (minefield.js): shoot
//   a way through or weave between them
// - escort: an ordinary ship asks to be seen to the next place, and pirates
//   come for it twice on the way (escort.js)
// - eclipse: a dark moon crosses the sun that lights you, and the light
//   dims through it (eclipse.js); only where there's a sun to cross
//   (withWhere: not at a station, not in the galaxy's gate)
// Nothing happens in the first while, or while something else is going on;
// then one comes along every minute or two, sooner the more trouble you've
// been making (heat: what you've shot down lately, and `wanted`: the law
// has you marked, standing.js: twice the hunts), and never the same thing
// twice running. While your shields are low (`calm`), nobody new comes
// after you: what happens then is one of the sights. And it paces the
// drama as Left 4 Dead's director does: an intensity that rises with the
// hits you take (`hurt`: damage this frame) and the kills you make (heat
// going up) and fades with time; past its peak nothing new comes, and once
// it has fallen back there's a breather (INTENSITY.relax seconds) before
// the next thing, so a fight is followed by a lull and not another fight.
//
// Where you are matters too (zoneOf: a place or the void; each event says
// where it can happen, its `zones`): at a place the hunts, the distress
// calls, the escorts; in the void the sights, the bounty hunter and a
// convoy going by; the capital ships either.
//
// createDirector({ rand, events }) → { update(dt, { side, heat, busy, travelling, calm, wanted, hurt, zone }) → event id or null, soon(id),
//   foretell(side) → { id, in } | null (what's next, and in how long: then that's what comes), intensity }
// `side` is sides.js's (`has(need)` says what it can bring; withWhere adds
// what the place you're at can), or null.
// `events` is the table it picks from: EVENTS, unless a map brings only some
// of them (the galaxy's roam.js opts in to what its scene can play)
