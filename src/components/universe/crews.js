// Who flies you round the universe map: Rick and Morty in the space cruiser,
// Luke and Artoo in an X-wing, Han and Chewie in the Millennium Falcon, or
// Walt and Jesse in their RV, which has grown wings.
// Pure data: the panel offers the ships, the scene builds the one picked and
// the comms box says these lines as things happen.
//
// A line is [speaker, text, clip?]; an exchange is a list of lines said in
// turn. A line with a clip (lib/clips.js) plays the recording under its
// subtitle; the rest are voiced by sounds.js. The speaker 'comms' is a
// voice on the radio that isn't one of the crew (no face).
// `arrive` has one exchange per place on the map (the stations and the
// planets), said the first time you reach it.
// Artoo and Chewie don't speak Basic: their lines are what they mean, in
// brackets, and sound like them (sounds.js).
