// Every weapon a ship can carry, as numbers. A leaf module: outfit.js reads
// it as it loads (the read-out's ordnance row) and weapons.js builds the
// armoury from outfit.js's parts, so the table sits apart from both and
// neither waits on the other.
//
// code: what goes over the wire with a shot (protocol.js), so the others
// draw it as it is; never reused, never over 15. line: which of the three
// it's fired from (weapons.js's LINES). damage: what one hit takes off
// another pilot's shields (a blaster bolt is protocol.js's DAMAGE; none over
// its DAMAGE_MAX). punch: against hunters and the Citadel (a hunter's hp is
// in punches). life and speed: of the blaster's. scale: how big each shot
// is drawn. The ordnance line's rounds are few: `ammo` of them, one back
// every `reload` seconds, and they home at `homing` radians a second.
