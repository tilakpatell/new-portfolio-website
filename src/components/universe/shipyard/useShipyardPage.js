// What a page needs to put the Shipyard (Shipyard.jsx) over its map: the
// loadouts, hulls, garage builds and tunes kept between visits (LOADOUT_KEY,
// HULL_KEY, GARAGE_KEY and TUNE_KEY, which every map that flies the ship reads), the
// ship as it's fitted, the yard's door and its note, and what an Apply or a
// sale does. The universe map and the galaxy both use it, so a fit made in
// either is on the ship in the other. The changes of state are pure
// functions (tested in Node); the hook is those, with the page's React
// state, its wallet and the browser's storage.
//
// useShipyardPage({ ship, unlocked }) → { loadouts, loadout, build, tune,
//   hulls, garage, dropped, setBuild(b), setTune(t), yard, setYard,
//   applyDraft({ diff, toBuy, draft }) → { ok, text, live } | { ok: false,
//   why, text }, sellPart(item), yardNote ({ text, n } | null, for
//   EarnNote), live ({ build, loadout, tune }), yardSaves }
// (the pure changes of state are yardPage.js's)
