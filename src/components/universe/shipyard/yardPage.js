// The Shipyard page's changes of state (useShipyardPage.js wires them to a
// page): what's kept between visits, a build flown, and a draft applied.
// Pure, so tested in Node; the storage and the wallet are handed in.
//
// readSaves(store) → { loadouts, hulls, garage, tune }: the saves under LOADOUT_KEY, HULL_KEY, GARAGE_KEY and TUNE_KEY, every crew's
// withBuild({ hulls, garage }, ship, b) → { hulls, garage } with `b` flown by `ship` (a build, or null for the stock hull), and a build also kept as its last, to go back to from stock
// keepBuild(store, saves, ship, b) → the same, written to the store (the hull always; the garage when `b` is a build)
// keepLoadouts(store, loadouts): written to the store
// keepTune(store, tunes, ship, tune) → the crews' tunes with `ship`'s (a tune of modules on its own ship, or {} for none), written to the store
// applyYardDraft({ ship, economy, loadouts, tunes, unlocked }, { diff, toBuy, draft }) → { result, loadouts, build?, tune? }: the yard is told
//   `result` ({ ok, text, live } or { ok: false, why, text }); on a go `loadouts` are to be kept, `build` is set only when the hull changed and `tune` only when the tune did
