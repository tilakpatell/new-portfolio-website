// The hangar: fitting out a ship for the universe map, the way a space sim's
// outfitting screen does it. Each ship has slots, and a part for each:
// its paint job (paint.js), strap-on boosters, manoeuvring thrusters, its
// guns, its shields and a set of fins. Parts are real (modules.js bolts
// them on, and the other pilots see them) and they change how it flies:
// boosters push the boost harder (and get to it quicker), thrusters swing
// it round faster, guns fire faster or hit harder, shields soak more or
// come back sooner. Nothing's free: every part draws power from the ship's
// own plant (and a fit that needs more than it makes won't go on), and
// adds mass, which takes the edge off how fast it turns. The factory parts
// are every ship's; a few more come straight away, and the best are
// earned, each with an achievement from one of the worlds.
//
// Pure data and numbers, so it's tested in Node: Hangar.jsx offers the
// parts and shows statsOf, scene.js flies on statsOf (ship.js's `tune`), and
// online/protocol.js sends what's fitted (only ids from here are believed).
