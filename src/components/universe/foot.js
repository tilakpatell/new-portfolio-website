// On foot: out of the ship and walking about on a planet, as plain numbers
// (no three.js), so it's tested in Node; footScene.js draws it and the
// scene drives it.
//
// Everything here is in the planet's own space: its middle at the origin,
// its surface R out. A person is where they stand (n, a unit vector out
// from the middle), which way they face (f, a unit vector along the ground)
// and how high they are off it (h, jumping). They walk and run where they
// face, turn on the spot, step sideways, jump, and go round any obstacle
// (the parked ship); the ground curves away under them, so a walk in a
// straight line goes round the planet.
//
// A planet with a trench round its middle (the Death Star's) has its rim
// to walk up to and no further: the ship comes down beside it, its door
// toward it, and a squad comes from your side of it.
//
// The planets are huge against a person (a few hundred of them tall at the
// smallest), so a squad of the Galactic Federation (who are after every crew
// that lands anywhere) comes over the horizon now and then: they walk at
// you, stop at a distance, and shoot, not very well (wide the first time,
// leading you as you run, never through a rock). Your bolts and theirs fly
// straight (the ground hardly curves over a shot's length) on the one bolt
// step every blaster on the site flies by (lib/combat/bolt.js): the people
// as capsules (footBodies), the planet and what stands on it as its solids
// (footSolids).
