// How the hunters fly and fight, as plain rules: who comes, how many, where
// from, how each one flies its attack, when it fires and where it aims, what
// its lasers hit, and when a pack gives up. Pure (no three.js), so it's
// tested in Node; hunters.js gives each one a model and draws the lasers.
//
// A pack comes in behind you (or ahead of you, an ambush; or out of portals,
// or a hangar) at points that are never inside a planet. Each hunter then
// flies attack runs, as fighters do:
// - 'set': out to a station round you (ahead and off to one side, a little
//   above or below). The station is fixed the moment it's picked, in the
//   map's own directions, so turning on the spot doesn't swing it away from
//   them; and one that can't be reached in a few seconds (you're running)
//   is given up for the run itself, which is then a chase.
// - 'run': at you, leading you, firing once you're in its sights and in
//   range; past you (or about to hit you), it breaks away to the other side.
//   Only so many of a pack are on a run at once (slotsFor): the rest hold
//   off and take their turn, so a big pack is a fight and not a wall.
// - 'tail': the quick ones (an interceptor, Vader, a Rick) sometimes stay on
//   you after a pass instead, sitting behind you and firing for a few
//   seconds, till you turn on them or shake them off.
// A pack hunts as one (lib/ai/squad): its attack runs are tokens (so many
// of a pack on a run at once, one on your tail at a time), and a hunter
// that's waiting for one does something with the wait: swings wide to your
// blind side to come in from behind (a flank, said once: event 'flank'),
// or sits off ahead across the way you're going (a blocker), or holds its
// station, weighed by how fast you're going and where it already is
// (lib/ai/utility). It has nerve: a pack that's lost most of itself breaks
// off together (event 'escaped' with why 'broke'). And it knows you only as
// it perceives you (lib/ai/perception): sent after you, it knows where you
// are; a planet between you hides you, it keeps the truth a couple of
// seconds (intuition), then chases its guess of you, which drifts the way
// you were going and fades, and a pack that has lost you altogether gives
// up. Its shots go to the guess, and a laser stops at a planet as before.
// They fly like fighters: each turns its nose at its own rate (a little
// quicker than yours at the fight's speed, less at its top: turnRateAt) and
// slows into a hard turn (it arcs round; it doesn't stop and come back),
// banks into it, keeps clear of the others in the pack, steers round
// planets, moons, stations and stars, and can't be flown through one. A
// planet between you is cover: they hold their fire, and a laser stops at
// it.
//
// And they fly the fight at your pace (fightSpeed): in the fight (swinging
// out, or on a run) one goes a little faster than you're going, never
// under a floor of its own top speed and never over its top, so at cruise
// a pass takes seconds and a turn-in can be followed, and when you boost
// they open up with you (a TIE a shade slower than your boost, so you can
// outrun one; an interceptor not). Far off they close flat out, so a pack
// still arrives; after prey they fly at the floor.
//
// Everything about you is read in all three dimensions (your nose and the
// way you're really going, climbing and diving too), so their lead is right
// when you loop. Shoot them down, or outrun them: far enough away for long
// enough and they give up and peel away.
//
// The crews' ship powers (shipPowers.js) reach them here: a ship handed to
// update as a `ghost` (Han's corkscrew, Rick mid-portal) isn't hit, the
// lasers flying on past; one with a `magnet` ({ x, y, z }: the RV's) drags
// the ones it holds (pull) toward it, their guns jammed; breakOff sends the
// ones on a run or your tail back out (Han's corkscrew, overshot); swallow
// puts out the lasers at a portal's mouth.
