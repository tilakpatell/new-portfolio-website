// Furnishing a landing: the planet's things and scatter (landings.js),
// built by its own file (./<id>.js, loaded now), stood on the sphere round
// where the ship's come down, and their solids handed to walk() as circles
// along the ground (foot.js's solidsOn). Everything's laid out from the
// planet's own seed, so it's the same for every pilot who lands there; a
// pilot coming down beside a friend is handed the friend's frame.
//
// furnish({ id, landing, frame, R, small, reduced, renderer, physical }) →
//   { group, solids, spots, lights, bodies, crowns, put(entry, position,
//   quaternion), update(t, dt, ctx?), ready, open(), dispose() }
//   group  in the planet's space (footScene's root: its middle at the origin),
//          built out of sight: footScene readies it all at once (its
//          pictures sent, its shaders made) and shows it, rather than each
//          thing being readied on its own and popping in as it was
//   solids the things' solids, once it's open ([{ n, r }])
//   lights grows too: the things' own lights, each kept where it is but out
//          of the scene's count, for footScene to show through the map's
//          few (./lamps.js: a light put in as you land made every lit
//          shader on the map again)
//   spots  grows too: where something answers you, the things with a door
//          (G there opens the planet's page) or a line to say ([{ n, r,
//          label?, say? }], r how near you have to be, map units)
//   bodies with `physical`, what can be knocked about (./bodies.js names
//          which; a model made with physical nodes is its own,
//          lib/three/colliders.js), once it's open: [{ object | meshes + index + locals (a
//          scatter's instance: its cell's meshes, and where it is among
//          them), position, quaternion, scale, box (metres, its own
//          frame), body, solids }]; their circles are in each one's own
//          solids, not in `solids`, so the walk goes into them (and shoves
//          them, ./physics.js) instead of round them; put() stands one
//          where its body has gone
//   crowns grows too: the leafy crowns of the trees, for leaves to fall
//          from (./litter.js): [{ x, z, r, lo, hi }], metres on the frame
//          (as the things' `at`), its reach and how high it starts and ends;
//          a scattered model's (its Leaves_NormalTree, a tree 2.5 m and up),
//          and a thing's builder's (its `crowns`, at spots of its own)
//   ready  a promise, once everything that's coming has come
//   open   the things' solids, bodies and spots put in effect, once
//          they're shown (none to walk into before they can be seen)
//
// The landing's door has a beacon over it (./beacon.js: the way into the
// planet's world, seen from the ship); a landing with no door is given one.
//
// A planet's file exports PROPS (things: (kit, opts) → { object, solids?,
// update? }, or a promise of one), SCATTER ((kit, opts) → { parts, radius }),
// and may export prepare(kit) for what its builders share. The kit is the
// galaxy surface's (galaxy/surface/kit.js: materials and parts baked into
// meshes), with `renderer` and `models` (./models.js) on it.
