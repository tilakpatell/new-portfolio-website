// the page's life), brought to the size the landing asks (by height,
// length or width, in metres), stood on y = 0 and centred; each use a copy
// whose geometry and textures are the cache's, so it's marked `shared` and
// a landing never frees them. A model that won't load is just missing.
//
// A spec's `node` takes one model out of a kit (a file of a family of
// them, sharing their textures: scripts/quaternius.mjs makes them), where
// the kit has it; its `tint` is a colour the model's own are multiplied by
// (the landing's rock, its dry grass), one tinted copy of each material a
// tint for the page's life, like the cache's own.
//
// Its leaves, flowers and grass move in the landing's wind and light as
// Bruno's crowns do (./canopy.js): each such material patched once, as it
// first comes, and each geometry drawn with one baked with what that reads.
