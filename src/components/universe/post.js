// How the universe map is drawn, after the scene itself: into an HDR target
// (multisampled short of a sharp screen: the canvas's own antialiasing
// doesn't reach an offscreen one, so the canvas goes without), then bloom for what's brighter than lit paint (the sun,
// lit windows, engines, shots), then one last pass: the tone map, the sRGB
// encoding and a light grade (a touch of contrast and saturation, a
// vignette), and, while the ship boosts, a rush: the picture smeared out
// from the ship toward the edges (the ship itself stays sharp) and the
// vignette drawn in. A laser hit flashes the edges red. Near the black hole
// out in deep space the picture bends round it: what's behind it is drawn
// pulled out round its shadow, as a real one's gravity bends the light
// (lens: where it is on the canvas and how big its shadow looks there), and
// twisted a little round with its spin. Only what's behind it: the scene's
// depth says what's nearer than the hole (the ship, in front of it), and
// that's drawn as it is. The shadow itself is drawn black over all but
// that (no glow gets into it, and falling in, the camera can be in past the
// sphere that draws it). The tone map is the shoulder of Khronos' neutral one without
// its toe: everything under 0.8 stays exactly as drawn (the faint Milky Way,
// the planets' night sides, the signs' colours) and only what's brighter is
// rounded off toward white. While frames run long (lib/three/pace) the scene
// and its passes are drawn less sharp, a step at a time, and the last pass
// spreads them over the whole canvas (which keeps its size, so the names and
// the HUD over it stay crisp); still too slow at the softest, the scene
// turns the post off and draws straight to the canvas, as before there was
// any. Short of that, lite() drops the bloom (the costliest pass) and keeps
// the last one, so the tone map and the grade stay.
//
// Bloom and the last pass both read the scene through finite(): a pixel
// that isn't a number (some GPUs make one of a pow() just below zero, or a
// normal of length zero) reads as black, and nothing reads hotter than 64.
// Unchecked, the blur smears one bad pixel into blocks of black across the
// screen, bigger at each of its levels.
//
// spaceEnvironment(renderer, sky, { light, colour }) is what shiny things
// reflect: the Milky Way, brought up, with the key light's glow where the
// key light is (`light`, the way toward it; `colour`, its star's, linear
// [r, g, b]) and a cool fill opposite, so metal catches the same light the
// scene is lit by.
//
// overlay(scene, camera) draws a second scene over the first with its own
// depth, before the bloom (the cockpit, from the pilot's seat, so its frame
// is always in front of whatever is out there and its lights glow too); null
// takes it off again.
//
// The finish (the universe map asks for it; the galaxy and its surfaces,
// which draw through here too, keep their picture as it was): a blue-noise
// dither after the sRGB encode, a fraction of a step, so the dark gradients
// round the suns and the Maw don't band at 8 bits; a little film grain on
// top while asked (grain(k), moving each frame); a touch of chromatic
// aberration toward the edges (aberration(k): red and blue read a little
// apart, more in the boost and a hit); an exposure that opens up in the dark
// and stops down into a sun (exposure(k), lib/three/exposure.js); and the
// bloom worked out at half the frame, its long side no more than 640
// (bloomSize). setLevel(level) follows lib/three/pace: the sun's flare
// (flareOn, drawn by the scene) goes at step 2, the aberration at 3, and
// both come back as the frames do.
//
// And a lens, the universe map's alone (off by default, so the galaxy's
// picture is as it was): a toe (setToe(lo, hi)) that takes what's darker
// than `lo` to black and leaves what's brighter than `hi` exactly as drawn,
// smooth between, so the sky between the stars has a floor while the faint
// things above it (the Milky Way's band, a night side's city lights, a
// sign's colour, all over 0.08) keep theirs; more contrast (contrast(k)); and
// a soft edge (defocus(k)): the fine detail toward the corners blurred over
// five reads, nothing in the middle third where the ship is, so the eye
// stays on it. The soft edge goes at pace step 3 with the aberration.
