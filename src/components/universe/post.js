// How the universe map is drawn, after the scene itself: into a
// multisampled HDR target (the canvas's own antialiasing doesn't reach an
// offscreen one), then bloom for what's brighter than lit paint (the sun,
// lit windows, engines, shots), then one last pass: the tone map, the sRGB
// encoding and a light grade (a touch of contrast and saturation, a
// vignette), and, while the ship boosts, a rush: the picture smeared out
// from the ship toward the edges (the ship itself stays sharp) and the
// vignette drawn in. A laser hit flashes the edges red. Near the black hole
// out in deep space the picture bends round it: what's behind it is drawn
// pulled out round its shadow, as a real one's gravity bends the light
// (lens: where it is on the canvas and how big its shadow looks there), and
// twisted a little round with its spin. Only what's behind it: the scene's
// depth says what's nearer than the hole (the ship, in front of it), and
// that's drawn as it is. The shadow itself is drawn black over all but
// that (no glow gets into it, and falling in, the camera can be in past the
// sphere that draws it). The tone map is the shoulder of Khronos' neutral one without
// its toe: everything under 0.8 stays exactly as drawn (the faint Milky Way,
// the planets' night sides, the signs' colours) and only what's brighter is
// rounded off toward white. When frames run long the scene turns the post
// off and draws straight to the canvas, as before there was any.
//
// Bloom and the last pass both read the scene through finite(): a pixel
// that isn't a number (some GPUs make one of a pow() just below zero, or a
// normal of length zero) reads as black, and nothing reads hotter than 64.
// Unchecked, the blur smears one bad pixel into blocks of black across the
// screen, bigger at each of its levels.
//
// spaceEnvironment(renderer, sky) is what shiny things reflect: the Milky
// Way, brought up, with the key light's glow where the key light is and a
// cool fill opposite, so metal catches the same light the scene is lit by.
//
// overlay(scene, camera) draws a second scene over the first with its own
// depth, before the bloom (the cockpit, from the pilot's seat, so its frame
// is always in front of whatever is out there and its lights glow too); null
// takes it off again.
