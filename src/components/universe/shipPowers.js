//
// - Luke and Artoo (the X-wing): Force Focus, time slowed for everyone but
//   you and the guns finding their mark; and a torpedo salvo, four locked at
//   once.
// - Han and Chewie (the Falcon): Never tell me the odds, a corkscrew no
//   gunner can follow (nothing hits you, and whoever was on you overshoots);
//   and Chewie on the quad guns, shooting at anything near, all the way round.
// - Rick and Morty (the cruiser): the portal gun, out on your target's tail
//   (or a long hop ahead); and Wubba lubba dub dub, the cruiser's big laser.
// - Walt and Jesse (the RV): Magnets, every fighter near dragged into a ball
//   ahead of you with its guns jammed; and Say my name, a crystal of
//   fulminated mercury thrown ahead (magnets, then the bang, is the idea).
// Powers are for the fights with the game's own ships (the hunters, the
