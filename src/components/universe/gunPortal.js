// Rick's portal gun, fired from the cruiser in flight, as plain numbers:
// tested in Node, flown by scene.js, drawn by gunPortalFx.js. A green bolt
// goes out of the nose, a portal splats open on the line the ship's flying,
// far enough ahead to fly into at the speed it's going, and holds a while
// before it shuts. Flown through, it's a portal: from anywhere at home it
// opens on Rick's dimension, the Central Finite Curve, coming out beside one
// of its worlds, nose on it, the Citadel off beyond it; from the Curve it
// opens on home (portals.js's transit), out beside the C-137 planet and
// facing it.
//
// GUN → its numbers (map units, seconds)
// gunSpot(ship) → { at: [x, y, z], normal }: where it opens and which way it faces
// gunOpen(age, shut?) → 0…1, how open it is `age` seconds after the shot
//   (shut: the age it was told to close at, the ship through)
// gunHit(a, b, spot, age) → the step a → b went through it while it was open
// worldSpot(id) → { x, y, z, heading }: where coming out shows you world `id`
// gunTransit(ship, rand?) → { via, out: { ship, sector, exit, world? } }: the
//   sector portal it stands in for, and the ship out the other side
