// The ship on the universe map, as plain numbers: where it is, which way it
// points, how fast it goes, and one step of flying it. Pure (no three.js),
// so it's tested in Node; the scene copies the numbers onto the model and
// the camera.
//
// It flies like a starfighter (Battlefront's): free all the way round. Which
// way it points is `heading`, `pitch` and `bank` (orient.js: 'YXZ' angles,
// heading 0 the nose down −z, growing turning left; pitch the nose up; bank
// the roll to the right), and it turns about its own three axes: the nose
// left and right (`turn`), up and down (`climb`, nose up +) and the roll
// about it (`roll`, right +), each in the ship's own frame, so it loops,
// rolls and flies upside down, and "up" on the stick is always up on the
// screen. Input is { throttle: −1…1, turn, climb, roll: −1…1, boost, and
// the visitor's sensitivity: turnRate, pitchRate, rollRate and level (1 as
// it comes: controls.js), and `tune`, what the parts fitted in the hangar
// do (outfit.js's statsOf: boost, accel, cruise, agility and level, each 1
// as it comes), and `surge`, a temporary lift to the boost and the pull-up
// on top of those (1 to 2, 1 as it comes: the galaxy's Overcharge pickup),
// after they're held to what a fit can do, so a ship with boosters has it
// too }. Each turn has a little inertia (`rate`,
// `tipRate`, `rollRate`, radians a second, easing toward what the stick
// asks), so it rolls into and out of everything rather than snapping, and
// all of it is slower the faster it goes. Let go of the roll and the nose
// and it rolls itself back upright (as quickly as `level` says; 0, never).
// It flies along its nose, so pointed up it climbs and pointed down it
// dives, faster the faster it goes; turning, it leans into the turn
// (`lean`, for the model and the camera only). It coasts to a stop, can't
// go through a planet (it bounces off) and is turned back at the edge of
// the map; near the ceiling or the floor (SHIP.ceiling above or below the
// disc) the nose comes round level in time for the speed it has, and past
// them it's eased back in.
//
// Between the places (deep.js) it opens up: the boost becomes a pulse drive
// (up to SHIP.pulse, easing back as it comes up on any place, so it never
// arrives at a planet at pulse speed, but not for one it's only flying past:
// deep.js's driveOpen; and cut to the boost while hunters have it
// interdicted, `input.interdicted`: true, or how far, 0 … 1, as a battle
// holds it coming in to the fight), the brakes and the
// coasting bite harder to match, the ceiling lifts to DEEP.ceiling out of
// the home system, and the wonders out there are as solid as the planets,
// and places the autopilot can take you (GOALS: every planet and station,
// and every wonder, the nebulae too). All but the black hole, which
// swallows: touch it at any speed and that's a crash, with no bounce (the
// scene plays out the fall, and the page goes on to what's beyond it). The
// Death Star's trench lets the ship down into it, all the way round.
//
// Super speed (the nav map's, nav.js): `input.overdrive` (up to OVERDRIVE)
// pushes the pulse drive past itself, that many times as fast as far as the
// drive is open where the ship is, with the brakes, the coasting and the
// pulse drive's push that many squared as hard, so it stops in the same room
// it would have and still comes up on every place at the boost. The
// autopilot flies it (its `od`); hunters' interdiction cuts it like the rest.
// Past the pulse drive's speed with no overdrive left (the pilot took the
// stick), it falls back as hard as it's over, so it drops out of super speed
// in a second or so rather than sailing on. Over what the drive allows
// anywhere it's eased down onto it (SHIP.settle), never braked at a flat
// rate into a wall.
