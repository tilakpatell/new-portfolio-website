// The ships that are models rather than built: the site owner's Meshy X-wing
// and Slave I, and the Star Wars models they sent for the map: a TIE
// interceptor, a Star Destroyer and a Corellian corvette (the Tantive IV)
// (scripts/build-universe.py cuts them down for it); and the galaxy's
// Y-wing, A-wing and TIE bomber, each over a built one. Each is loaded the
// first time it's wanted, then copied, sharing its geometry and textures,
// for every ship of its kind; until it's come, the kind is built
// (trafficModels.js: the X-wing, the interceptor, the Star Destroyer and the
// corvette all have built stand-ins; Slave I has none and waits). Their
// engines and lights are turned up so they glow like the built ones.
// Traffic, hunters and the director's set pieces share one fleet.
//
// Its shaders are made before anything new is drawn (`prepare`, the
// scene's: compiled off the main thread, so a ship arriving doesn't stall a
// frame): a loaded model only takes over from its stand-in once they're
// ready, and each ship made keeps out of sight until they are (a frame or
// so, after the first of its kind).
//
// The built ones are made in code, which takes a moment: the scene builds
// one of each kind ahead, as it starts (for their shaders), and hands them
// over (`stock`), so the first of a kind to fly doesn't stall a frame being
// built.
