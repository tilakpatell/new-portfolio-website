// Flying to another pilot: the autopilot's goal for them, a parking spot
// behind their ship that moves as they do. Pure (no three.js, no React), so
// it's tested in Node; scene.js and the galaxy's scene fly it.
//
// A pilot's goal is `pilot:<their id>`. It's in the space only while their
// pose is (pilots.js's pose(id): sampled, in this place, not hidden), so a
// pilot who goes offline or out of sight takes their goal with them and the
// trip ends; nothing of theirs is kept that they aren't sending now.
//
// pilotId(goal) → their id, or null for any other goal
// parkBehind(pose, { back }) → { x, y, z, heading }: `back` units behind
//   them along their heading, at their height, facing the way they face
// pilotSpace(space, id, pose) → the space with their goal in it (or out of
//   it, for no pose); every other goal as it was
// reached(ship, pose, within) → whether the ship is within reach of them
// REAIM_MS: how often the park is worked out again while the trip runs
