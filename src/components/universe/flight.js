// The universe map's camera, as plain numbers: where it sits for the overview
// and for each universe, how it gets from one to the other, and where a point
// lands on screen. Pure (no three.js objects), so it's tested in Node and the
// scene only copies the numbers onto its camera.
//
// A pose is { target: [x, y, z], dist, pitch }: the camera looks at `target`
// from `dist` away, raised `pitch` radians above the map's plane. The map's
// own turn (yaw) is the scene's, applied to the planets, not to the camera.
//
// The panel covers part of the canvas (the right side on a desktop, the
// bottom sheet on a phone, the nav along the top), so the view is centred in
// the part that's left: a lens shift, which the scene applies with
// camera.setViewOffset(w, h, -sx, -sy, w, h).
