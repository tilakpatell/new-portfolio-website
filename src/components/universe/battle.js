// A battle at the front: Battlefront 2's Fleet Assault, as plain rules.
// Pure (no three.js), so it's tested in Node; battleScene.js draws it and
// front.js runs it on the map. The design:
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-fleet-war-design.md.
//
// Two fleets face each other across the front, the attacker's line on one
// side of the middle and the defender's on the other, along `axis`. Each
// side has its capital ships (wars.js: a flagship and its escorts) and its
// fighters, as many as the device can draw a side (perSide), brought back
// from the side's tickets when they're shot down.
//
// - The fighters (battleAi.js flies them): a fighter dogfights the nearest
//   of the other side's, an interceptor goes after bombers first, a bomber
//   flies torpedo runs at the defender's objectives or, for the defender,
//   at the attacker's ships.
// - The capital ships (battleCapitals.js lays them out and fights them):
//   every battery fires turbolasers at the other side's capital ships, and
//   point-defence at fighters (you too) that come close.
// - The objectives: the defender's flagship has two shield generators
//   (phase 1: its shield holds everything else off), then its bridge
//   (phase 2), then its reactor (phase 3). When the reactor goes, the
//   flagship breaks up and the attacker has won. Your shots on them count
//   `youShare` times, the AI's `aiShare`: a battle left to itself still
//   moves, slowly, and you're what decides it.
// - The end: the attacker wins when the defender's flagship goes; the
//   defender wins when the attacker's flagship goes, when the attacker's out
//   of tickets and fighters, or when the clock runs out.
//
// This file keeps the wiring, the bolts, what they and your shots hit, the
// clock, what your guns lock on to and the end; battleKit.js has the
// numbers (BATTLE) and the vector bits all of them share.
//
// In the galaxy (galaxy/warfront.js) a battle is sized to its ships (`lines`,
// `radius`), kept off its planet and out of a Death Star's shield (`avoid`:
// spheres its fighters steer clear of), on the clock every pilot shares
// (`clock` its length, `elapsed` how far in it is already), with the damage
// other pilots did to its objectives counted (`shared(id)` → theirs) and
// yours told (`onMine(id, damage)`), and no side that can run out of
// tickets (`tickets: false`: the fighters keep coming, the count's only a
// count, and it's fought to its clock or its objectives).
//
// The galaxy's set pieces (galaxy/warpieces/) reach in: an ion cannon
// disables a capital ship a while (disable: its guns quiet, hits on it count
// more), its batteries are targets of their own (a run down its hull shoots
// them out), a capital ship can be moved and turned (a Hammerhead's ram:
// moveCapital, turnCapital), and runners fly for the jump through the battle
// (addRunner, battleRunners.js: gone after by the other side, and by you).
//
// The galaxy's kinds of battle (galaxy/battles.js) ask for three more: the
// defender's objectives on an Interdictor among its escorts instead of its
// flagship (`objectivesOn: 'interdictor'`: its fall wins the battle, the
// flagship keeps its hull), an ace on either side (`ace: { [team]: { kind,
// name, hp } }`: one fighter flown as that kind, named on its bracket, gone
// for good once down), and runners that decide the battle (`runners`: an
// evacuation's or a blockade's, launched through it, `need` of them out
// winning it for their side, all of them down losing it).
//
// And in the galaxy, the battle every pilot there shares: with a `plan`
// (battlePlan.js: its objectives stage by stage) and a `director`
// (battleDirector.js's state, now), the battle doesn't decide itself. Its
// objectives' hp and stage, its shield and its end are the director's
// (battleStages.js takes them in); your shots on an objective count a punch
// each and are told (onMine); the AI's fire on an objective only lights it
// up, and on a capital ship's hull wears it down but never sinks it; and it
// ends only when it's told to (end).
//
// createBattle({ war, attacker, at, axis, perSide, rand, lines, radius,
//   avoid, clock, elapsed, shared, onMine, tickets, objectivesOn, ace,
//   runners, plan, director }) → battle (with
//   runners, disable(id, s), wreck(id), moveCapital(cap, d), turnCapital(cap, axis, a),
//   addRunner({ team, kind, size, hp, from, to, speed })):
//   { teams, capitals, fighters, bolts, phase, clock, over, you, defender, lines, radius, length,
//   attacker, ahead, stageOpen, opensIn, setYou(team | null), update(dt, you) → events, hit(from, to,
//   damage) → hit | null, strike(id, damage) → hit | null (a ram on a fighter), fire(team, from, dir, kind, target), targets,
//   info, end(winner, why, ago), setDifficulty(d), tactics, fleet }
// `you`: { x, y, z, alive } (the ship, as the scene has it), or null.
// update(dt) steps the battle BATTLE.step at a time, whatever the frame
// rate, so the same seed fights the same battle on any screen; `ahead` is
// how far the frame's past the last step, and each fighter's and runner's
// `seen` is where it is by then (drawn there, locked on to there).
// Events: { type: 'down', team, kind, role, at, mine, ace? }, { type: 'hurt', damage,
// kind }, { type: 'sub', sub, kind, phase, at, mine }, { type: 'phase',
// phase }, { type: 'shield', down: true }, { type: 'capital', id, kind,
