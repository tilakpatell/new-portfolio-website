// The shipyard's rules: a draft refit, what it costs, what it will fit and
// what can be sold. The yard (shipyard/Shipyard.jsx) edits a draft
// { build, loadout } and nothing is bought or fitted until Apply, which
// checks out every unowned item at once (economy.js's checkout) and then
// fits the changes `diff` lists, in its order. Pure (no React, no
// three.js), tested in Node. The design:
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-shipyard-overhaul-design.md, Part 2.
//
// A draft is { build, loadout, tune }: the hull (a garage build, or null for
// the crew's own ship), the parts, and the tune (shipyard/build.js: modules
// on the crew's own ship, kept per crew whichever hull is flown, but only
// flown, checked and bought while the hull is the stock one).
//
// openDraft(live) → draft; setPart, setModule, setHull, rollDraft → draft;
// pasteDraft(draft, code, { unlocked, economy }) → { draft } | { error };
// check(draft, { kind, unlocked, economy }) → { ok, issues, toBuy, total,
//   short, power, capacity, mass }; diff(draft, live) → [{ slot, from, to,
//   module, tune? }]; sellable({ loadouts, hulls, garage, tune, keep }, economy) →
//   [{ item, refund }]; itemOfPart, itemOfModule → catalog.js's item.
