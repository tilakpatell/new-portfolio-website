// The room the pilots meet in: public Nostr relays carrying everything, so
// it works from any network a web page can load from (each browser opens
// ordinary secure WebSockets out to the relays; nothing has to reach in, so
// no NAT or firewall gets in the way), and no pilot ever learns another's IP
// address (only the relays see yours, as any website does). The site is
// static, so there's no server of its own: these are run by others, free.
//
// What each browser sends goes out as Nostr events of an ephemeral kind
// (KIND: relays pass it on to whoever's listening and keep nothing), tagged
// with the room, to every relay in RELAYS; each listens for the same on all
// of them, and an event that comes in from more than one is taken once (by
// its id). Messages are bundled: whatever's waiting goes out together at
// most every FLUSH_MS (only the latest pose and pointer of a bundle are
// kept), which keeps each pilot well inside what the relays allow. The
// sockets are pool.js's: one to each relay, shared by every room on the
// page, each room a subscription of its own on them (`pool`, the page's
// for the WebSocket class and relays given, unless one's handed in).
//
// Who you are is the key you sign with (identity.js's: kept in this browser
// unless you've said not to, or a key of the tab's own when another tab's
// already flying on it; the same in every room you join, visitKeys(): the
// site's own and each world's, so the person walking your Bree is the one in
// the roster, and a block holds everywhere): every event is signed, the
// relays check it, and anything that matters (a hello, a hit, being shot
// down, an alliance, leaving) is checked again here, so no one can speak as
// another pilot. A key lasts, so a pilot's words from a past visit are
// still theirs, and mustn't be played back as new: an event much older than
// the pilot's others is dropped, and so is one from a pilot first heard
// whose time is further than SKEW_S from your clock. Each room's events
// carry a tag of the visit's own ('visit'), and a goodbye (signed ahead, so
// it can go out as the page closes) is believed only when its tag is the
// one the pilot's other words, checked, carry now: one recorded on a past
// visit removes nobody. This module is ready only once the
// identity's roll-call of the browser's tabs is over (a moment, ROLL_MS at
// most), so nothing that imports it signs as another tab's pilot.
//
// joinRoom({ appId, relays, WebSocket, pool, keys }, roomId) → { selfId, ready (resolves
// once a relay's listening, rejects if none answer), makeAction(ns) →
// { send(data, { target }), onMessage(data, { peerId }) }, onPeerJoin(id),
// onPeerLeave(id), onStatus('online' | 'connecting'), leave() }: what
// client.js takes. (Other games pass `latest`, the kinds of message of
// which only the newest in a bundle matters, and `cheap`, those trusted to
// the relays' own check of the signature.)
//
// A room can be heard by cell (src/lib/net/cells.js), for a world too big
// for everyone to hear everyone: joined with `cells` (a function giving the
// tags to listen for, or null for all), its REQ asks for '#g' too, so the
// relays pass on only the events of pilots near you. setCell(tag) is what
// your own events carry from then (['g', tag]); setCells(tags) is what you
// listen for, asked of the relays again (one REQ each, under the same id) on
// the next tick and only when the set changed, since the relays count REQs
// (said ten times in a frame, it's one REQ). An event from a cell not
// listened for (a relay that ignores '#g', or one still on the REQ before)
// is dropped here and counted (stats().offCell). A message for one
// pilot carries their cell as well, the one their last words carried, so a
// hit or an ask from cells away still passes their filter. A room joined
// without `cells`, and never told otherwise, asks and sends exactly what it
// always did.
