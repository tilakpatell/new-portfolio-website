// Who is aboard the two Death Stars, as plain data: the model each kind is
// drawn with, how tall it stands, the tint multiplied into its colours, the
// side it fights for, what it carries, how much it takes to put down, the
// voice its lines are said in, and the mind it gets by default. One table
// so the figures, the minds, the fights and the voices all agree on who a
// `kind` is. Most people are the site’s rigged models loaded by URL
// (Chewbacca is the cockpit’s, made and rigged by Meshy on the crew’s own
// skeleton, so he walks and fights on their clips); a few are another model
// dressed differently (the Death Star trooper is the officer in black under
// a helmet built in code, the Royal Guard is the senate guard in red), and
// two (the IT-O and the dianoga) are built in code until
// scripts/meshy-deathstar.mjs makes them models. Tarkin, the Emperor,
// Jerjerrod, Motti and Tagge get their voices along with the world’s lines,
// through the voices pipeline, so they have none here. Pure.
