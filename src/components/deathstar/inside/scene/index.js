// The Death Star’s inside, drawn: what module.js draws through each frame.
// It holds nothing the game needs. The rooms come and go with the stream
// (built near you, drawn while seen, freed far off); the doors’ leaves are
// drawn here from the game’s door states, since a room leaves its doorways
// open in their frames (a sliding door parts sideways into the wall, a
// blast door drops from above, a hatch swings on its hinge); the player
// is a rigged figure (figures.js), a stormtrooper whenever in armour; the
// people aboard are drawn from the game’s crew (people.js) and the bolts
// in the air from its combat (fx.js), the blades, the windows’ views and
// what the game’s events look like (show.js); and the camera stands over the
// shoulder or at the eyes, kept out of the walls (camera.js). The game
// steps at 30 Hz and a frame falls between two steps, so the player is
// drawn between where the last two steps put them. Everything is in the
// house look (lib/three/house.js); bloom is the module’s (rt.gfx.post), so
// render() draws just the scene through the camera.
//
//   leafPlaces(door, open) → [{ x0, x1, y0, y1, lead, swing? }]   pure: the leaves’ rects still in the
//     doorway (x along the door from its middle, y up from its floor), `lead` the edge that moves;
//     a hatch’s one leaf is always whole, turned `swing` radians on its x0 edge
//   createTrack() → { push(time, body), at(alpha) → { x, y, z, yaw }, speed(), velocity(out?), turn() }   pure:
//     a body between its last two steps; a jump of more than 3 m (a lift ride, a teleport) is drawn where it lands
//   playerAct({ crouch, sit, moving, aim, gun, blade, shotAgo, swungAgo }) → { base, upper }   pure: what the
//     player’s figure plays: sat in a seat, crouched still or crouch-walking, the gun held out while aiming and fired
//     for a moment after each shot, a blade’s stroke for a moment after each swing
//   roomsOf(stream) → { shown(roomId), built(roomId), dt }   what people.js is told of the rooms: drawn
//     while the stream shows them, standing from when they are built until the stream frees them (a
//     body is let go only then, so the two mustn’t be swapped: a door shut on the dead would take them)
//   createScene(renderer, { tier, small, station }) → { scene, camera, layout, ready, sync, hear, warm, resize, render, timeScale, tune, dispose }
//     sync(g, alpha, look?)   once a frame, after the game’s steps: g as rules/game.js keeps it
//       ({ side, you: body & { room, crouch, hp, gun, armour, hero, pitch? }, doors, time, crew?, combat? }),
//       alpha how far the frame is from the last step to the next; look: { yaw, pitch, view, aim } as
//       the module holds them (the mouse turns the eye every frame, not every step); without it, the
//       body’s yaw, level, third person. crew: rules/brains.js’s ({ people }), each person drawn;
//       combat: rules/combat.js’s ({ bolts }), every bolt in the air given to the effects, then they step
//     hear(events)   the game’s events drained since the last frame: the flashes, sparks and clashes they make
//     ready: settles once the rooms’ builders are in hand
//     warm(target?) → Promise   compiles the fight’s effects for where the scene is drawn (the bloom
//       chain’s buffer, or the screen without one), so the first shot doesn’t stall a frame
//     resize(w, h), render(), dispose() (puts the renderer’s tone mapping back as it found it)
