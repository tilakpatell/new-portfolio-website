// The people aboard, drawn from what the crew’s rules say of each
// ({ id, kind, x, y, z, yaw, room, hp, mode, anim, aim }). Each kind is
// loaded once and copied (lib/three/gltf.js caches a model by its URL and
// figures.js copies it for each person): the crew, the troops and
// Chewbacca (the cockpit’s Meshy model, on the crew’s own skeleton) on the
// site’s shared rig, walked and fought on its clips; the surfaces’ droids
// as they were modelled, rocking as they roll; and two built here in code
// until scripts/meshy-deathstar.mjs makes them models: the IT-O (a black
// sphere with its red eye and its syringe) and the dianoga (an eyestalk and
// tentacles up out of the compactor’s water). The Death Star trooper wears
// his black helmet, built here too, over the officer’s uniform.
//
// Only the tier’s count nearest the camera animate (24 high, 14 mid, 8
// low), a body still going down before anyone living; the rest stand
// still. Every figure is posed the first time it is drawn, played on to
// where what it is doing comes to rest (a body found dead lies there, not
// falling as you look), and a still one is played on again whenever the
// rules have it do something new (so a body killed with no turn at moving
// lies on the deck, one that loses its turn mid-fall lands, and one whose
// fall ran its course out of sight is seen lying when it comes back into
// view). Figures are made only for people within 60 m in a room that
// stands, nearest first and two a frame, so a crowd coming into view never
// stalls a frame; anyone past 60 m or in a room that isn’t drawn is
// hidden, and anyone whose room is freed is let go. A person is drawn
// between the game’s last two steps, so they move smoothly at any frame
// rate. A body stays where it fell for as long as the crew keeps it, until
// its room is freed: hidden while the room stands undrawn (a door shut on
// it), let go for good once the stream frees the room. One that fell where
// no room stood is drawn lying there once its room is built.
//

//   actOf(person, { blade, armed }) → { base, full, upper, raised, dead }   pure: what the figure plays
//     for what the rules say the person is doing: a base state in place of the walk (a stance, a
//     console, talk, a seat, a kneel; null: walking, running or standing on its gait), a whole-body
//     one-shot (a flinch), an upper-body loop (aiming, shooting), whether its gun is up, and death
//   hitClip(dir, yaw, high) → clip   pure: the flinch for a hit from `dir` (the way the bolt went) on
//     someone facing `yaw`: the chest or the head from in front, a shoulder from the side, doubled up
//     from behind
//   fallClip(dir, yaw, id) → clip   pure: back from a hit in front, forward from one behind; with no
//     hit known, the same one for the same person every time
//   aimAngles(from, yaw, at) → { yaw, pitch }   pure: the turn (+ right) and tilt (+ up) from facing `yaw` to `at`
//   createTrack() → { push(body, dt), at(alpha), speed(), velocity(out?), turn() }   pure: a body between
//     its last two steps; dt: the frame’s time since the last push
//   motionFrom(track, yaw) → figures.js’s motion   pure: the speed ahead and aside, and the turn
//   blocks(at, tall, camera, focus) → bool   pure: whether a body at `at` stands between the camera
//     and the point it looks at you by (your chest), or has the camera inside it
//   createPeople(scene, kit, { tier, renderer, adopt, layout }) → { sync(crew, alpha, cameraAt, rooms?), hear(events), figure(id), stage(id, how | null), handOf(id),
//     muzzle(id, out), dispose() }
//     layout: the station's (rules/layout.js), for the dead to fall against as ragdolls (without it
//     they fall on their clips); rooms.open(doorId) and rooms.off (layout.offTags's): its doors and
//     floors as they are now; rooms.camera and rooms.focus (your chest): anyone between them is faded,
//     and rooms.ahead (a little way past you in the view) with rooms.side: a friend before it too;
//     rooms.seatOf(person) (rules/seats.js): where one sat down is drawn, on the seat
//     adopt(object): handed each figure and gun as it goes into the scene (the house look’s adopt)
//     crew: { people: Map | [person] } (or the people themselves); alpha: how far the frame is from the
//     last step to the next; cameraAt: { x, y, z }
//     rooms: { shown(roomId), built(roomId), dt }: the rooms drawn and the rooms standing (the stream’s
