// The flight's terrain worker: a leaf's mesh, normals, heights and clutter
// (lib/land/flight/leafMesh.js) made off the main thread, every buffer handed
// back without a copy. One job at a time (runtime/workers.js gives a worker
// one), so a cancel for a queued leaf never reaches here; one for the leaf
// being made comes after its answer, which the pool then ignores. A job of
// `type: 'raster'` is the planet map's (lib/land/flight/mapRaster.js): a 2 km
// square's biomes and heights, asked behind the ground.
