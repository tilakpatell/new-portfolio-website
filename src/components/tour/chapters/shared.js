// What the audience tours share (steps.js's TOURS.recruiter, .player and
// .mixed). A tour is chapters, { id, title, path, stops }: one light route
// each, or `path: null` to stay where the last one was (the end cards), or
// `brief` to take its stops from a world's basics (briefs.js). A stop is as
// steps.js has it, with `actions` (buttons: `to` a route, `href` a link or
// the PDF, `tour` an audience to start next; a world is only ever offered,
// never loaded), `todo` (the checklist's row it shows, src/data/todo.js),
// `release` (keys let through to try them) and `wait` (a target that mounts
// late). `text`, and an action's `label`, may be a function of the ctx,
// { key, touch, ship, mb } (mb: worlds.js's WORLD_MB). See the spec's
// 3.2 (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-audience-tours-and-ui-audit-design.md).

// The shell: the stops of the view's own tour each audience keeps as its
// first chapter (lib/tour's planFor prepends it, without the view tour's
// hello and done, and opens it with the audience's HELLO; TourHost reads
// both through steps.js). On a phone the menu stands in for the nav's links
// and search. The player's tour leaves the map's stops to its Flying chapter.
