// The player's tour: what there is to play, in about seven minutes. The
// ship (the map's own basics, briefs.js's '/universe/fly'), the galaxy, the
// worlds, the games, playing together, the checklist and the colours.
// Chapter 1 is the shell (shared.js's SHELL_STOPS); these follow, on the
// map, and then the tour walks into eight of the worlds (WALKED, each a
// chapter marked `world`): it waits for each, its download gate included,
// so a phone takes the whole tour too; a world kept light is toured as it
// is. The rest are offered from their cards (Go there).

// Star Wars' worlds are the galaxy's chapter; every other world is a card in
// the worlds chapter, in the map's order. Each card is the guide's line on
// it (guide/abouts.js), so a world added to the map has its card once it
// has its basics.
