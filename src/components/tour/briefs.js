// the guide is (guide/routes); the guide (guide/pages.js) has every control
// and tip, so this keeps to the few you need in the first minute.
//
// A stop is { id, title, text, keys, touch, at }: `keys` and `touch` are
// rows as the guide writes them ([keys, what they do]), the keyboard's or a
// phone's, whichever this device is; `at` lights something on the page
// (data-tour), and a card in the middle where it isn't showing.
