// The Scranton branch's people, as the show dresses them: Michael's charcoal
// suit and light blue shirt, Dwight's mustard short sleeves, tie and glasses,
// Jim's rolled sleeves and loose tie, Pam's pink cardigan, Angela's blonde
// bun, Stanley's moustache and reading glasses, Kevin's size...
//
// The figures were modelled for the site with Meshy (scripts/meshy.mjs: a
// concept image of each, a textured model from it, a skeleton), one skinned
// mesh a person in public/models/office/cast/, standing with the arms out.
// Each is posed by turning its bones: sitting at a desk, standing, or in a
// wheelchair. The head looks round, at the camera or at the bin, nods and
// shakes; the hands type, wave, cheer, shrug, fold and reach for things.
//
// Anyone else (Albuquerque's people) comes as a spec of their own figure on
// the same skeleton: { id, model (its .glb), height }.
//
// Someone on their feet can stand on clips instead (loadPeople's `clips`,
// person's `anim`): Rick's walk and run and the UAL's calm idle, borrowed
// (lib/three/clipLibrary.js) and laid under the same passes (the hands'
// reaches, the gestures, the head), on an animator of their own
// (lib/three/animator.js) with its stride paced to the ground the scene
// moves them over (./motion.js), so their feet don't slide; they stand up
// out of a chair and sit down into one (the UAL's), and play anything in
// the clip library (a wave, a talk, a drink at the kitchen counter). The
// figures themselves carry no clips (people.test.js): the clips come from
// their own files. Anyone whose clips don't come stands as before.
