// What the crews say in a galaxy far, far away (systems.js): the four crews
// of the universe map (universe/crews.js) flying the Star Wars galaxy, over
// the same comms. Pure data, in the crews' own shape: a line is
// [speaker, text, clip?], an exchange is a list of lines said in turn,
// 'comms' is a voice on the radio that isn't the crew, and Artoo and Chewie
// say what they mean, in brackets.
//
// `arrive` has one exchange per system, said the first time you drop out of
// hyperspace there: Luke and Han have history with half of them (and Artoo,
// whose memory was never wiped, with more than Luke knows), Rick and Morty
// are tourists from another universe, and Walt and Jesse are a long way from
// Albuquerque. `events` are the jump between systems (and `course`, the
// first time the nose comes onto another system's star), and the moments the
// systems play out (the Death Star's tractor beam and its hangar at
// Alderaan, Hoth's ion cannon and the transports getting away, the
// superlaser over Scarif and its shield, the second Death Star's shield at
// Endor, a Star Destroyer arriving, and the hyperdrive coming back once
// you're clear of an Interdictor's gravity well). `interdicted` is the
// Interdictor pulling you out of hyperspace (interdiction.js), over the
// universe map's own interdiction line. `hunted` and `kill` are the galaxy's
// own hunters (galaxy/hunted.js): the Separatists' droids, and the Imperial
// remnant's TIEs over the New Republic's worlds (shot down, they're TIEs:
// the crews' own lines). galaxyCrew lays all this over a crew's own lines.
