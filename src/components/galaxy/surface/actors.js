// Who's about on a world: Jawas round their sandcrawler, banthas grazing,
// stormtroopers on patrol, Ewoks in their village, Gamorreans at a Hutt's gate.
// Each wanders near its home (stopping, looking about, going on), or walks
// its beat (a patrol's path, round and round), or stands where it was put;
// someone with something to say turns to you as you come up, and says it
// when you ask (the scene shows it).
//
// And they live there. One with `needs` goes to the site's places and uses
// them (needs.js: a drink at the cantina's bar, a vaporator knelt at and
// fixed, a seat sat in), a slot each, facing as the place says. Two or
// three who want company stop and talk, a step apart, taking turns, the
// speaker's hands going; a band walks together, its leader in front; a
// walker in your way steps aside, and one you walk into is shoved
// (lib/ai/social.js). One with a word for you turns its head as you come
// up and waves the first time (a Tusken holds his gaffi stick high), and
// talks with its hands as it says its line. A shot or a blast it hears
// (hear(): the scene says where) startles a townsman into a run away from
// it, makes a stall keeper duck, and stops a trooper, his blaster up and
// his head turned to it (needs.js's manners). Their bodies show all of
// it: each moves on its feet by the ground it covers (lib/ai/body.js's
// motion, from where its brain put it a frame apart: the legs paced to it,
// no sliding, no walking on the spot), its clips and head through its
// figure's calls, which do nothing on a figure that can't.
//
// A kind with a model (catalog/*.js) is that model (walking with its own
// clips, if it came rigged); otherwise figures.js builds it, or props/*.js
// does (a walker: an AT-AT, an AT-ST, its legs going as it goes). `model:
// false` builds it even where there's a model (a walker that should walk).
//
// site.life: [{ kind, n, at: [x, z], spread, roam, speed, path, still, hang (metres: hung upside down, the feet that high),
//   face, y (hovering: a probe droid), name, says: [line…] (a line: text,
//   or [who, text]), voice (the voice their own lines are said in, where it
//   isn't their name's: voicelines.js; `says` can be talk.js's tree, by
//   the state of things), scale, solid, id (a quest's name for them), quest (the
//   quest they give: quests.js's), reach (talked to from this far: a Hutt
//   on his dais), level (the height of the floor they're on, where there
//   are floors over floors), hidden (not there till a quest says), dive
//   (over the sea, a glide that dives into it now and then: an aiwha;
//   floats.js's diveAt options, its heights over the water), needs
//   (needs.js: the kinds of the site's `wants` it goes to), fears / chases
//   (actor kinds it runs from, or goes after, when it has seen them),
//   group (the entry's figures walk as a band, the first in front), sit
//   (sat where it stands: a booth's), hears / greets / chats (needs.js's
//   manner, where its kind's isn't right) }]
// site.wants: [{ id, kind, at: [x, z], pause?, slots?, spots?, clip?, base?,
//   face? }] (where the people go, and what they do there: needs.js)
//
