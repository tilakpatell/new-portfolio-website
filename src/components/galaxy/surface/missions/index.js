//
//   kind       'chase'
//   start      where you start, on the bike, and `yaw`, which way you face
//   waypoints  the scouts' way, from their camp to where they're going
//   scouts     how many; `gaps` (metres along the way at the off), `lanes`
//              (metres to the right of it, negative left), `speeds` (m/s)
//   hp         hits to bring one down
//   stars      seconds: three stars under the first, two under the second
//   lines      what your crew say, by ship's crew: at the off, at the first
//              one down, when one's near the end, and at the end either way
//   ends       how it ended, for the card: `won` and `lost` (its titles),
//              and `why` (a line for each way to lose: `lost` for a chase)
//
// Or kind 'quest': the surface's quest engine (../quests.js) runs it, from
// `start` on `ride` (or on foot, with no ride) to the end of `quest` (won)
// or a fail or going down (lost: `why` 'time' or 'down'); `stars` are on the
// whole run, `lines` are `start`, `won` and `lost`, and `reset` is effects
// (as a quest step's) that put the world back when it starts again.
//
// Or kind 'assault': a battle for a world's command posts (./assault.js
// runs it; the maps are ./assaults.js's, merged in below).
