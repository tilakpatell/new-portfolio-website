// A galactic assault, as plain numbers (missions/index.js has the maps:
// Hoth's and Geonosis's): two armies on a world, the command posts between
// them, and you one soldier among them. The attackers come for the posts
// of the phase; hold a post with more soldiers than the enemy and its
// meter moves your way, to neutral and then to yours; take every post of
// the phase and the next begins, until the last falls. A soldier down
// comes back at a post of theirs after a while, for a ticket; a side with
// no tickets and nobody standing has lost. Pure and seeded, so it's
// tested; the drawing is assaultScene.js and the surface scene runs it.
//
// Under fire a soldier is suppressed (`suppress`, 0…1, up with every bolt
// that comes its way and fading): kept down, it shoots worse and moves at
// a crouch, and it looks for cover, the far side of the nearest rock,
// crate or wall from whoever's shooting (the world's solids, `env.solids`),
// and holds there a while, where a bolt is less likely to find it. A
// side's reinforcements come back together in waves, the attackers' on a
// staging line short of their objective (forwardOf).
//
// Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-galactic-assault-design.md
//
// The armies fight by squads (lib/ai/squad, the NPC intelligence design):
// each side's soldiers up are grouped by reach every TACTICS.every seconds;
// a squad's confidence (what's left of it against what's facing it, its
// side's recent losses counted) sets its posture: holding, a defending
// squad keeps behind its frontline (TACTICS.buffer short of the nearest
// enemy, so the two armies don't melt into one melee and you can read
// who's where; the attackers' job is to go in, and they do);
// worried, it falls back in halves (the half nearest the enemy goes
// TACTICS.back metres rearward, a defender's to the rear of the post it
// holds, while the rest hold and cover, then the other half); confident,
// it presses, and the soldiers at its lane ends
// go round the enemy's flank. The post each soldier wants stays the
// objective under it (pickPost). The shots at you are tokens
// (RULES.atYouMax at once, each held a shot's time, so they take turns).
// Events: { type: 'posture', side, squad, posture } when a squad's changes.
//
// And in the galaxy's war (gcw.js): the result's `posts` are the posts each
// side took while you were up (once each), which pages/GalaxySurface.jsx
// counts for your side; sideFor(mission, side) is the war's side on this map
// ('attack', 'defend' or null) and warSideOf(mission, k) the other way.
//
// And for the soldiers' bodies (assaultScene.js draws them): soldierBody(b,
// s) reads what a soldier's doing as a brain's step for lib/ai/body's
// bodyFrom (its mode: down, cover, pinned, retreat, covering, flank, fight
// or advance; and what it aims at), BATTLE_BODY says what each mode looks
// like, a `down` event says where the killing shot came `from` ([x, z]) and
// a soldier's shot at another names its `target`. They read the battle and
// never change it.
