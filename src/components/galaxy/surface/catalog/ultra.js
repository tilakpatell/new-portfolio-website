// The ultra cut of a surface model: for the kinds seen most (each world's
// landmark and what it places most), a <kind>.ultra.glb beside the plain
// file, up to four times the catalogue's `tris` with maps up to 8192, made
// by the importer that made the plain one with --ultra (scripts/ultra/
// commands.mjs lists them). A kind that has one says so in its entry,
// `ultra: { tris, tex }`; the placer loads it at the ultra level only, and
// at ultra draws every model whole at any distance (no far copy). The
// catalogue's `tris` stays the high cut, so nothing at high gets heavier.
// Which file a level loads and whether it swaps to the far copy are read by
// the placer through ./index.js (modelUrlFor, wantsLod, on lib/budgets);
// this file holds the cut's numbers for the importers and the tests.
