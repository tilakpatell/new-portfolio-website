//     fogMix, exposure } (the house's LOOK shape, colours as ints)
//   exposureOf(site, base = 1) → the exposure: the site's own (1 unless it
//     says) times `base` (1 on the surface: its post tone-maps with its own
//     shoulder, universe/post.js, so the house's ACES-to-Neutral lift isn't
//     wanted there)

//     gets (none with no ground under it; grass only where the site grows
//     some)

//     after the scene was adopted the house took on (0 for nothing)
//
//   LOOK: the world's look for components/worlds/looks.js (its art, tone and
//     bloom, and why)
//
// A site's `look`: { shadow, edge: [from, to], fogBelow, halo } (colours as
// '#rrggbb', as the sites write them); left out, the shadow is the sky a
// third of the way from its zenith to its horizon, darkened: a blue sky
// shades blue, a sunset violet.
