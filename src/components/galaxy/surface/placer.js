// Putting things on a world: a kind (a vaporator, a sandcrawler, an Ewok
// hut) at a spot, turned and scaled, stood on the ground there, and made
// solid where it's solid. A kind with a model (catalog/*.js, from
// Sketchfab) is that model; one without (or whose model won't load) is
// built in code (props/*.js); a kind that's neither is left out. Scattered
// kinds (rocks by the hundred, palms, huts) are drawn instanced: one draw
// for all of them.
//
// createPlacer({ parent, kit, world, warm, house, models, kitTint }) → { put(spec),
// scatter(kind, items, opts), update(t, dt, you), signal(name, on) (to the
// built things that move when something happens: a trapdoor, a gate),
// setZone(inZone), ready (a promise: everything asked for so far is in),
// dispose() }
//   `models`: the book of models kinds are looked up in (catalog's
//   SURFACE_MODELS unless a page hands in its own); `props`, `scatter`:
//   the builds (props/'s PROPS and SCATTER unless a page hands in its own).
//   A thing or a scatter row whose `model` is 'kit:<pack>/<Name>' is that
//   kit model (lib/three/kit: public/kit/<pack>/), in place of its kind's:
//   each pack loaded once a placer, its leaves and bark in the world's wind
//   (the galaxy kit's clock and way) and in the house's look (`house`, the
//   world's lib/three/house), its materials tinted by `kitTint` (the
//   site's flora tint, flora.js: { [material name]: colour }). Scattered, it's drawn as a kind's model is,
//   its LOD1 far off; put, its parts stand under one group. A tree is solid
//   at its trunk (the manifest's `trunk`), anything else by its box. A
//   rigged one (the manifest's `rig`) is refused as one that won't load is,
//   said once a model: its skin is for its own mixer.
//   setKitLoader(fn) → the kits' loader (fn(pack, { house, wind }) → a kit,
//   as loadKit's) for the tests; null puts loadKit back.
//   With `seated` (ultra: amounts.js), whatever stands on the ground is
//   seated on the lowest ground under its footprint (seat.js), so it never
//   floats on a slope; below ultra, things stand as they always have.
//   Given `shadowOnly` (near.js's createShadowPhase(…).only), scattered
//   things don't cast shadows themselves: a stand-in for each part, drawn
//   only into the sun's shadow, holds just the instances near `you`
//   (near.js), found again each NEAR.step metres you walk.
//   Things put with `zone` (a room's build) are drawn only while you're in a
//   zone, and everything else only while you're not (setZone).
//   spec: { kind, at: [x, z], yaw, pitch, roll (radians: a walker on its
//   side), scale, y (over the ground), sink (into it), abs (y is the height
//   itself, not over the ground), solid (false: walk through it; or { r } /
//   { box: [hw, hd] } in place of its own), model (false: its build, even
//   where there's a model; 'kit:<pack>/<Name>': that kit model, its build
//   if it won't load), opts (for a built one), zone (it's a room's),

//   universe's Death Star over Scarif's sea; scaled to `metres` along its
