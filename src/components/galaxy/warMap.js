// as plain rules: each front and attack an arrow from the system its fleets
// come from to the one they're after, and a fleet on it that closes in as its
// side gains; and which battle a pilot's nearest to joining. Pure, tested.
//
// A front's fleets are the liberator's, from its best-held neighbour of the
// front (the nearest of those, on a tie); an attack's come from where it was
// launched (gcw.js's `origin`) while that's still the attacker's, or else
// from its best-held neighbour.
// The arrow bends to whichever side of its way has more room from the other
// systems' dots and the names beside them (roomOf), the left on a tie; two
// along one lane, one each way, bend each to its own left, so they part. It
// stops clear of both systems' dots; a raid's drawn dotted, the decisive
// battle doubled (the drawing's warmap.css's). Its fleet's crest goes about
// as far along it as its side's got, slid to where it's off the other
// systems and the crests before it.
