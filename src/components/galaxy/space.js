// A star system as somewhere to fly: the space ship.js's step() and
// autopilot() fly the ship through (universe/ship.js's SPACE has the same
// shape). Pure numbers, so it's tested in Node.
//
// A system is free all the way round: no disc to keep to, so the ceiling and
// the floor are a long way off (CEILING), and it ends at EDGE, where the ship
// is turned back (beyond it there's only hyperspace: the way to the next
// system is a jump, not a flight). Out in the open it opens up into the
// sublight drive (up to PULSE), so crossing the system doesn't drag, and it
// drops back to the boost as you come up on the planet or anything big round
// it (so you never arrive at it flat out). It goes by where the ship's
// heading, as the universe map's does (deep.js's gapAlong): flying past one,
// wide of it, or away from it, it stays open, so there's no wall round the
// planet or a battle's capital ships to crawl through.
//
// Well out from everything, the drive opens again into super speed: the
// ship's own overdrive (ship.js's OVERDRIVE, up to three times what the
// drive allows, its brakes squared so it stops in the same room), by how
// wide open it is the way it's going (wideAlong: none within WIDE.near of
// anything big's reach, all of it WIDE.ramp further out), so crossing an
// open system doesn't drag and nothing changes near the planet, where the
// moment from the films plays. The scene hands overdriveAt's number to
// step() as input.overdrive while the pilot boosts, and to the autopilot.
//
// A planet counts from just over its surface (AIR, of its radius), not from
// its reach: the worlds are grown (fit.js), so Hoth's reach is 150 units of
// air over its ground, and with the drive shut all through it, climbing out
// took twelve seconds at the boost, like glue.
//
// EDGE, CEILING, PULSE, WIDE; FAR (the camera's far plane, for all of it in view)
// makeSpace(solids) → { edge, ceilingAt, openness, driveAt, driveAlong, wideAlong, overdriveAt, homeAt, boostAt, brakeAt, coastAt, solids, goals }
// solids: [{ id, at: [x, y, z], r, reach, band?, swallow? }]: what the ship
// bumps into (the planet, its moons, the Death Star, the big rocks…); the
// ones with `goal` are somewhere the autopilot can take you.
