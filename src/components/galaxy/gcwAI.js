// war (gcw.js hands in its dice), so every pilot's campaign decides alike;
// gcw.js works the campaign through a step at a time with these.
//
// Each side weighs a target by its doctrine (sides.js's DOCTRINE): what it's
// worth, how far its hold's gone, how much of its holder's it would cut off
// from their capital, whether it makes an area whole, and whether an attack
// could take it at all (an attack thrown at what it can't take is a wasted
// one: the old raider kept hurling itself at Hutt worlds it never took).

// step, as the war counts them; pointsCount(side, holder, battle) → whether
// they count there at all; lean(count, side, opened?) → the underdog's (or
// the leader's, or the stretched side's) multiplier; supplied(owner, side,
// capital) → Set; cutOff(owner, id, capital) → systems cut off by taking id;
// areaWhole(owner, id, side) → 1 | 0; attackPace(c) → an attack's %/hour;
// reaches(c, reach) → whether it would take a system; targetOf(c) → an
// attack's target; originOf(owner, control, sys, by) → where it comes from;
