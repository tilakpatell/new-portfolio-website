// The galaxy's war's battle in the system you're in, flown in (gcw.js says
// what's on where; battles.js lays it out at the planet; universe/battle.js
// fights it; universe/battleScene.js draws it). Not a game you start: the
// war you fight in (allegiance.js's theatre) is on, on the clock every pilot
// shares, and if there's a battle in this system when you drop in (or one
// starts while you're here) it's there in front of you, and you're in it on
// the side you swore to; unsworn, you're in nobody's sights and score
// nothing, and the crew asks you which it's to be. The crew calls it out
// (crews.js's battle lines, each with the side, the war and the system); the
// system's own fleets stand aside while it's on (world.js's quiet).
//
// Shared: the battle is the one every pilot in the system sees. What the
// pilots here have done is a tally (universe/tally.js, its epoch the
// battle's id) sent to the others in the system (the client's `fight`), and
// the battle's course is worked out from it, the battle's seed and the
// clock everyone shares (universe/battleDirector.js, running the battle's
// plan, universe/battlePlan.js): its objectives' hp, its stages, its
// runners, the capital ships it loses, and its end, so a shield generator
// one pilot takes down goes down for all of them, a pilot dropping in late
// sees what one who's been there all along does, and the battle's won by
// one side for everyone in it. The dogfight round you (universe/battle.js)
// is your own: the spectacle, and your part in it. You're known in that
// tally by a tally id of your own, kept with your shares in the battle's
// save (BATTLE_KEY, written as your word goes out), as warState.js keeps
// the war's: a reload, or a new identity, is a new peer id telling the same
// again, and the others count you once; and a page back in the battle picks
// up what it had done.
//
// What you did counts in the war (warState.js: points for each objective
// and fighter you take down, the battle won by the side that won it,
// counted once for everyone in it), sent to everyone online (`war`), and
// for your side: the attacker's objectives are only the attacker's to take
// (a defender's shots at their own flagship are nobody's business), and a
// defender scores the attacker's fighters down, a bomber as an intercept,
// which shores up the objective the attacker's AI is on (`g:<id>`). Each
// pilot counts itself in once, on its side (`here:a`, `here:d`), and the
// more pilots a side has, the less each one's damage counts (the director's
// scale). A set piece's target that's one side's to take whoever attacks
// (an enemy Star Destroyer's reactor, Endor's generator) counts only that
// side's shots (ctx.mineAs).
//
// And the set pieces (warpieces/: Endor's shield generator, superlaser and
// reactor run, Hoth's ion cannon and transports, Scarif's ram onto the gate,
// a hangar run into any Star Destroyer), run alongside the battle with its
// context (`ctx`); what they say of the ship (kept inside a tunnel, slowed,
// caught in a blast) goes back to the scene in what update returns.
//
// And a space level's Starfighter Assault (surface/missions/starfighter.js,
// the flow design's decision 4), asked for by the page (`?battle=
// starfighter`): starfighter({ level, side, draw }) stands the war's battle
// here aside and fights the level's in its place, laid by battles.js's
// layStarfighter, run by its own plan on the director, on your side (the
// oath's, or the one asked for); `draw(laid)` draws the level's pack
// round it (dispose() when it goes). It counts nothing in the war: it's a
// game you start, not the war's battle.
