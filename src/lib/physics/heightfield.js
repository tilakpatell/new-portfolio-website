// A 64 m cell's ground as a Rapier heightfield: the same heights it is
// drawn from (src/lib/land/cell.js), so the wheels' rays meet what you see.
//
// Ours are row-major (heights[iz × n + ix], +x along a row); Rapier's are
// a column-major matrix whose rows run along z, so the array is transposed
// on the way in. The body stands at the cell's middle (Rapier centres a
// heightfield on its body). heightfield.test.js shoots 200 rays to prove it.
// A floor: it meets everything but the car's bumper. Its triangles' inside
// edges are fixed (Rapier's FIX_INTERNAL_EDGES), so a crate sliding over
// flat ground slides on instead of catching on them and hopping; the
// wheels' rays don't care. Heights that are short or not numbers throw.
// No three.js, no DOM.
