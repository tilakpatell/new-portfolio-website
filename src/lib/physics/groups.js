// everything, object meets everything and bumpers, bumper meets objects
// only): bit 1 is his "all", worn by the floor and by everything that
// should meet it. The five new ones: a character (a figure's capsule: the
// floor, objects, other characters, zones; it does not wear his "all" bit,
// the floor's and the object's filters name it instead, so a query for the
// floor and objects, a brain's sight or a bolt's flight, never meets a
// figure's capsule), a hurtbox (a region of a figure, a sensor: meets
// nothing by contact and is found only by the two query groups), a zone
// (a sensor volume: characters), and two groups no collider wears, for
// queries: a projectile's path (the floor, objects, hurtboxes) and a line
// of sight (the floor, objects, characters). `filterOf` builds a query's
// groups: every membership, and the named groups in its filter; since
// objects wear the floor's bit, a filter that names the floor admits them
// too (there is no floor-only query). Pure.
