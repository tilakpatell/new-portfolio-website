// Where a heavy asset is fetched from. scripts/assets-upload.mjs puts the
// big models and textures in a Supabase Storage bucket by content hash and
// writes src/data/assets-manifest.json; with VITE_ASSET_BASE set at build,
// a path the manifest names is asked of the bucket (its CDN, a year's cache),
// anything else of the site as before. The build keeps only the entries whose
// file on disk still has that hash (scripts/assets-manifest.mjs), so the bytes
// are the same either way and nothing drawn changes. The first remote failure
// (the bucket down, or blocked by a network or an extension) sends that load
// and every later one to the local file for the rest of the visit, so a
// visitor who can't reach the bucket sees the site as it was. A 404 on one
// hashed URL (the manifest and the bucket out of step) sends that file alone
// to the site; an abort (its world left) is passed on, never a fallback.
