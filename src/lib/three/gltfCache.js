// One fetch and parse of each model file for the page's life, and copies of it
// that are safe to hand out.
//
// Every place that wants a model used to load it itself, so the same GLB was
// fetched and parsed again for each (the fleet, the galaxy's ships, the
// planets' models). loadGLTF(url) keeps the promise for each url, so the
// second asker and every one after gets the first's result, and a copy of it
// comes from cloneScene(gltf): geometry and textures are shared with the
// cached original (the big, GPU-held things, uploaded once), and each copy has
// materials of its own, so a copy can be tinted, faded or disposed without
// touching the others or the original. A skinned model's copies are made with
// SkeletonUtils so each has bones of its own.
//
// loadGLTF(url, { loader }) → Promise<GLTF | null>
//   The loader is a GLTFLoader with the meshopt decoder, made the first time
//   it's wanted (a test hands in a stand-in with just loadAsync(url); the cache
//   is by url alone, so whichever loader asks first is the one that loads it).
//   A load that fails resolves null and isn't kept, so a later call tries again.
// cloneScene(gltf) → Object3D
// gltfStats() → { requests, parses }: loadGLTF calls and loads actually started
//   (counted in dev builds only; nought in a production one)
// clearGLTFCache(): forgets everything, and the counts. For tests only: a
//   page keeps what it loaded.
