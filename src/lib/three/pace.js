// Keeping a scene smooth when it gets busy: how sharp to draw it, judged
// frame by frame.
//
// It watches the time between frames. A frame that came late (well past the
// display's own beat, and slower than about 45 a second) is a missed one; when
// a run of frames has too many, the scene is drawn a step less sharp at once,
// and again a moment later if that wasn't enough. Once frames have come on
// time for a while it goes back up a step, and if that brings the misses back
// straight away it waits twice as long before trying again (so it settles
// rather than see-sawing). One slow frame (a hiccup) never moves it, and
// neither does a pause (a tab in the background, the scene resting).
//
// The display's beat is read from the frames themselves (the quicker ones),
// and a fast screen isn't chased past what looks smooth. A beat that seems to
// have slowed is believed only slowly: from the frames alone, a graphics chip
// that can only manage 30 a second on a 60 Hz screen looks just like a laptop
// on battery capped at 30, and the first wants helping straight away; the
// second, at worst, is drawn a little softer for its first half a minute.
//
// At its softest with frames still late for `floorRuns` runs in a row (a
// few seconds), it calls `onFloor` once: by default lib/detail's
// `strained`, which holds a strong graphics card at the high detail level
// from then on, since ultra's textures and geometry turned out to be more
// than this machine could carry. `stuck` says how many runs in a row it has
// been late there (0 once one comes on time).
//
// reset() starts it again as new, for a new scene on the same screen: its
// sharpest, its first wait, nothing counted. Only the display's beat, which
// is the screen's, and having told `onFloor`, which is the machine's, are
// kept.
//
// `climb: false` never goes back up a step: for a renderer whose sharpness
// is its canvas's size, where every change reallocates the drawing buffer
// and waits for the graphics chip (most of a second when it's busy), so a
// see-saw costs far more than it saves (the world runtime's).
//
// createPace({ steps, window, missed, settle, wait, longest, floorRuns, onFloor, climb }) →
//   { frame(now) → the new scale when it changes, else null, scale, level, stuck, reset(), set(level) }
// `set(level)` puts it at a step and holds it there as its ceiling (lib/three/
// calibrate's answer): it steps down from there if it must, never up past it.
// `now` is the frame's timestamp (ms); the scale is one of `steps`, sharpest first.
