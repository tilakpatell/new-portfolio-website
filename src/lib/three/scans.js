// The surfaces' scans by role (the grounds underfoot, the props' trims):
// what each is and how big a tile of it is on the ground, and its maps, from
// one of two sets. The site's own photo scans (Poly Haven, CC0:
// public/cc0/galaxy/, made by scripts/galaxy-textures.mjs) by default; a
// Star Wars world on the game's own maps instead (its site's
// `look.scanned: 'bf2017'`: public/textures/galaxy/bf2017/, made by
// scripts/bf2017-textures.mjs from Battlefront II's, the owner's rule that
// every texture in a Star Wars world is the game's). One world is built at
// a time, so the set is the page's: surface/scene.js chooses it as a world
// is made and puts the site's back as it goes. Moved down from
// galaxy/surface/kit.js so the flight's ground wears the same scans as the
// walkable surfaces.
//
//   SCANS[role] → the site's own set: { source, id, name, authors, license, metres, arm, mean }
//   wearScanSet('cc0' | 'bf2017'), scanSet() → the set worn
//   scanOf(role) → the worn set's row, or null
//   scanFiles(role, { xl }) → its files
//   loadScan(role, { xl }) → its maps (lib/three/core's loadCore)
