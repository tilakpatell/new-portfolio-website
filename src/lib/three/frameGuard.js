// No frame waits for a shader or a picture: whatever isn't ready on the
// graphics chip yet is left out of the frame and readied behind it, and
// drawn a few frames later. The same rule Minecraft keeps for its chunks
// (a bounded amount sent each frame, nothing drawn before it's ready),
// kept for every draw.
//
// three.js compiles a material's shader and sends its pictures the first
// time it's drawn, and that frame waits for both: a hunter pack arriving, a
// planet's close-up maps or a model streaming in mid-walk each stopped a
// world for a fraction of a second to over a second
// (docs/research/2026-10-07-frame-hitches.md). The guard wraps the
// renderer's own renderBufferDirect (three draws through the instance, so
// every draw passes here): a material that has never been compiled, or that
// uses a picture never sent, isn't drawn this frame. After the frame, the
// waiting ones are readied under a budget (`compileMs` of main-thread time
// and `uploadMB` of pictures a frame): the world's own `adopt` hooks first
// (its house look, so the shader compiled is the one it will draw with),
// the pictures sent, the shader compiled; then a fence, and once the chip
// says the shader has linked, it draws from then on and isn't looked at
// again.
//
// Only the frame itself is held back: a Scene drawn to the canvas, or to a
// buffer the canvas's size (a composer's) or one its owner says is the
// frame's (`frames`: a composer drawn softer than the canvas, its last pass
// drawing it up), with no override material. The size in whole pixels: a
// composer sizes its buffers at the canvas's size times the pixel ratio,
// unrounded (1470 wide at 1.75 is 2572.5), and WebGL truncates them to the
// canvas's 2572, so compared as given most windows' frames went ungated,
// and a world's frame was gated or not by the width of the window. Left
// alone: the shadow pass (no scene: its depth shaders are small and
// shared), anything drawn outside a Scene (a post pass's quad: leaving it
// out would leave its picture undrawn), the drawings a world makes for
// itself (a floor bake, an environment map, a reflection: into buffers of
// their own size, or with one material over everything, and what's left out
// of those is wrong for good, not for a frame), and a material once it's
// ready, whatever three does to it after (a transparent, double-sided one
// is marked changed twice a frame), unless it's been changed into another
// shader: a look or a scan put on it late (a new onBeforeCompile, a new
// program key), or a map put on or taken off. Then it's readied again
// behind the frame, as if new, rather than made again in the middle of one;
// as is one that's been freed (dispose(): its shader with it) and is drawn
// again.
//
// The pictures it waits for are a patch's too (gpuWork's picturesIn: a
// scan's, the look's), not only the material's own.
//
// A warm draw (gpuWork's warmDraw: a prepare's draw of everything behind
// the loading screen, or lib/stage3d's before the first frame of a world
// that isn't prepared) is always drawn whole: it's there to send
// everything, and what it held back would be left out of the first frames
// seen, a world up as its sky alone and filling in a few materials a frame.
// A renderer's first frame can be drawn whole too (`firstWhole`: the
// Cybertron backdrop's, whose shaders are made ahead but not its pictures).
// What three drew ungated is known to have linked (that draw linked it), so
// the frames after it, gated, draw it at once.
//
// guard(renderer, { uploadMB, compileMs, frame, invalidate, frames(target), firstWhole }) → { enabled,
//   invalidate, adopt(scene, fn) → undo, pending(), dispose() }, one per renderer (asked again, the same).
// In development, a frame in which three still compiled a shader mid-draw
// says so in the console, so what's still slipping through can be found.
// heldBack() → what every live guard is still readying, the sum of their
// pending(); in development it's window.__tpGuardPending too, for the
// scripts that shoot a world (scripts/gpu-parity.mjs) to know it's all on
