// Every model's and texture's bytes, through one pool the size this device
// can take (lib/net/assetFetch: two at once on a saver connection, four on a
// weak device or a phone, six on a desktop, eight at ultra), asked of
// the public bucket first where it holds the file (lib/assetBase), the site
// after. lib/three/gltf.js's loader and textures.js fetch through here, so
// every loader on the site gets the retries, the timeouts, the short-body
// check and the one request per URL without asking.
//
// A world's loads belong to it: worldScope() at its start makes the scope
// every load started after it joins (by default; a load can name its own
// `signal`), and scope.end() at its dispose stops whatever of them is still
// queued or in flight, so leaving a world stops its downloads at once and a
// late answer reaches nothing. atPriority(p, fn) runs fn with its loads at
// priority p (the figure nearest the visitor first).
//
// loadBytes(path, { priority, signal }) → Promise<ArrayBuffer>
// worldScope(name) → { signal, end(), progress() → { bytes, total, files } }
// atPriority(p, fn) → fn()
// assetPool() → the pool (its progress() for a check); useAssetPool(p) for a test
