# The Battlefront II (2017) drop: the coverage ledger

Written 2026-10-10 19:15 UTC from the bucket (113,478 objects listed) by `scripts/bf2017-coverage.mjs`. One row per object (a model with all its LOD files; a map and each of its five extras kinds; `data/` by top folder and record type), each in one state: used, owned, excluded, not-uploaded, unowned. `npm run coverage:bf2017` fails while any row is unowned, or owned by a lane that has merged.

**Rows:** 80,837 · used 4,667 · owned 57,498 · excluded 14,044 · not-uploaded 4,628 · unowned 0

## Owned, by lane
