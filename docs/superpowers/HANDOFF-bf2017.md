# Hand-off: the Battlefront II (2017) pipeline

The design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-battlefront-2017-asset-pipeline-design.md`; the bucket’s numbers, `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-assets/inventory.md`; the drop and its credit, `docs/assets/battlefront-2017.md`.

## Done

- **The design, the inventory and the plans** (PR #802, carried by the phase 0 PR).
- **Phase 0, the tools** (PR #805): the decision entry and the assets page; `scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs` and `scripts/bf2017-import.mjs` over five tested modules under `scripts/lib/` (`bf2017-manifest`, `bf2017-paths`, `bf2017-textures`, `rig-parts`, `catalog-write`); the committed fixture (`scripts/fixtures/bf2017/`, 39.6 KB); the empty `catalog/bf2017.js`, last in `GROUPS`. Nothing on the site changed. Tried on two real models and nothing kept: Luke’s hilt (920 triangles, 212 KB, the shot in `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-phase0/`) and Luke’s rotj body with `--rig` (the whole rig kept, 254 joints with fingers, face and physics; LOD2 706 KB, LOD4 236 KB; drawn in its bind pose).

## Left

In order:

1. **Phase 1, the heroes with their hilts**: the owner chose, on 2026-10-10, to keep the 2017 rig in full: no pruning, no renaming to Meshy’s names; the site learns the game’s skeleton. Phase 0’s rig prune (plan task 4) was written, tried on Luke (254 joints to 63, and his fingers and face went with it) and then taken out; the import keeps all 254 and puts `grip` under `Wep_Root`. The phase 1 plan is the revised one (merged in from `claude/nice-mayer-jqow5k`): one shared clip library on the game’s skeleton, a loader that knows its sockets, the hilts in `Wep_Root`. Its first rigged import should check `skins.length === 1` and that a figure’s joint count equals its body’s (the parts’ duplicate skeletons joined by `rig-parts.mjs`). Then: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phase1-heroes.md`. Its task 2 adds parts by full manifest name (Luke’s head and hair are under `characters/heads/`, not his body’s folder: the body alone is 1.596 m and headless) and the spine rename; both go into `partsOf`, so the fetch’s `--parts` takes names too.
2. Phases 2 to 10 as the spec’s table orders them, each with its own plan when it starts.
3. Textures: every map the hilt and Luke’s body name was in the bucket as KTX2 on 2026-10-10, none as PNG. A map not there yet prints `missing:` in the import and the material goes without it; re-fetch and re-import when the upload has it.
4. Normals as KTX2 (UASTC) where `scripts/ktx2.mjs report` says it pays: phase 9’s, with the ultra cuts.

## Checking it

The keys: `SUPABASE_URL` and `BF2017_KEY` (a key that can read the private `bf2017-assets` bucket) in `.env.local`, never committed; the owner holds them. In a cloud session they are already environment variables (the key as `SUPA_KEY`; the fetch takes either), so drop `--env-file`.

```
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs manifest
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs --list 'gameplay/equipment/heroes/*'

The tests need no keys and no network: `npx vitest run scripts/lib/bf2017-* scripts/lib/rig-parts.test.mjs scripts/lib/catalog-write.test.mjs scripts/bf2017-import.test.mjs src/components/galaxy/surface/catalog`.

## Lane W: closed; lane L owns the worlds

Lane W (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phaseW-worlds.md`) is superseded by lane L (PR #810's `-phaseL-levels.md`: each world drawn from the game's own level layout, heightmap and shapes, Hoth first). Lane W ends with the tools lane L can reuse (PR __PR__); it places nothing on any world.

### Done (PR __PR__)

- **Kits** (`scripts/bf2017-kit.mjs` over `scripts/lib/bf2017-kit.mjs`, tested on a two-piece fixture, no network): a level system's pieces in one GLB, a node a piece by its name at the game's own origin, each piece's parts joined by material, the materials shared and kept apart by name (the test caught `dedup` merging Hoth's `M_Wall` and `M_Floor`, alike in all but the name). `bf2017-import.mjs` exports its LOD reader for it. The kit row goes to a world's `catalog/bf2017-<world>.js`'s `KITS` (none in this PR) and its credit to `modelCredits.json`.
- **The surfaces' roles on the game's maps** (the owner's rule of 04:40, plan 003d83b19): `scripts/lib/bf2017-roles.mjs`'s `ROLE_SOURCES` (tested: every role, only the drop's textures, no sequel era) and `scripts/bf2017-textures.mjs` make all 29 roles under `public/textures/galaxy/bf2017/` (16 MB; the scans' set is 13 MB). Chosen from a census of what the bucket holds and checked on a contact sheet: the game's tiling detail arrays where it has them (Hoth's rock, the desert's sand, Mos Eisley's walls), terrain and trim sets otherwise (Naboo's gravel and tiles, Endor's mud and bark, Sullust's sand and concrete, Kamino's dome metal, the MC80's painted metal, Kashyyyk's planks, the Imperial bunker's tread plate cut from its trim sheet, Yavin's temple stone and floor). Six first picks were rejected on the sheet (atlases or a blend mask). `lib/three/scans.js` now wears one set for the page (`wearScanSet`, tested), taken by `surface/scene.js` from a site's `look.scanned`; no site sets it yet, so nothing on the site changes until a world does.
- **Hoth's skies, for lane G**: `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-hoth/skies.md` and the main-arena probe (`cloudy_vfx/78e8837b`) at 128 and 64 under `public/textures/galaxy/sky/` (`scripts/bf2017-sky.mjs`, its pure parts tested). The level's panoramas are in the manifest but not in the bucket.

### What was measured on Hoth (a trial, not shipped)

Echo Base was rebuilt on the game's kits by hand and by grid before lane L's plan arrived: the main hangar from the large hangar set (two 30.72 m bays and the end piece, mirrored: 41 × 31 × 72 m), the base's inside panelled with the wall system (81 panels, windows, beds, the bacta tank, the game's floor), the hangar shells' missing maps from the snow and concrete roles. It is kept off this PR on the unpushed local branch `claude/bf2017-worlds-hoth-placement-unpushed` (with the sky-loader trial on `claude/bf2017-levelsky-unpushed`); both go with this session's container. The pictures are `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-hoth/echo-base-trial.jpg`. What it cost, one whole frame in software GL (`renderer.info`), main against the trial:

| view | level | calls | triangles | textures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the hangar's mouth | high | 226 → 247 | 923k → 941k | 745 → 756 |
| the hangar's mouth | low | 227 → 248 | 729k → 747k | 741 → 755 |
| inside the hangar | high | 131 → 152 | 816k → 834k | 745 → 757 |
| the base's entry corridor | high | 52 → 126 | 158k → 311k | 742 → 754 |
| from the landing (`galaxy-check BUDGET=1`) | high | 156 → 156 (row 274) | 865k → 865k (row 1.66M) | 742 → 754; models 14.7 → 16.8 MB of 60 |
| from the landing (`galaxy-check BUDGET=1`) | low | 156 → 156 (row 350) | 671k → 671k (row 800k) | 740 → 754; models 14.7 → 16.8 MB of 20 |

`hoth-check.mjs` passed on the trial (no built people, both kits laid, none of the site's scans fetched). Things lane L may want from it: the hangar kit at LOD1 was 4,620 triangles, 3 maps, 119 KB; the wall kit 25,246 triangles, 9 maps, 1.87 MB; the panels as clones cost one call a piece (74 calls for the base's inside, worth instancing); the large hangar shells come without maps, so they need a role. Hoth's texture count was already 742 against the contract's 60 on main, before any of this. Main also logs one shader error on Hoth (a fog chunk reading `mvPosition` where there is none), not this lane's.

### Left

- To lane L: the worlds. To turn the game's roles on for a world, set its site's `look: { scanned: 'bf2017' }` and look at the sheet; the flight world's ground and the planet bodies read the same scans module (the site's set, outside a surface world). Roles to look at again in their own worlds: grass and leaves are Endor's forest floor (the game's grass is cards), the beach is the desert's second detail layer, and the detail arrays' normals were taken as they come.
- To lane G: Hoth's probe and `skies.md`; the panoramas when the upload reaches them.
- The planet-flight world's Echo Base landmark (`src/lib/land/flight/`) could wear the game's hangar once lane L has it.
