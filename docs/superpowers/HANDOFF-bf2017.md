# Hand-off: the Battlefront II (2017) pipeline

The design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-battlefront-2017-asset-pipeline-design.md`; the bucket’s numbers, `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-assets/inventory.md`; the drop and its credit, `docs/assets/battlefront-2017.md`.

## Done

- **The design, the inventory and the plans** (PR #802, carried by the phase 0 PR).
- **Phase 0, the tools** (PR #805): the decision entry and the assets page; `scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs` and `scripts/bf2017-import.mjs` over five tested modules under `scripts/lib/` (`bf2017-manifest`, `bf2017-paths`, `bf2017-textures`, `rig-parts`, `catalog-write`); the committed fixture (`scripts/fixtures/bf2017/`, 39.6 KB); the empty `catalog/bf2017.js`, last in `GROUPS`. Nothing on the site changed. Tried on two real models and nothing kept: Luke’s hilt (920 triangles, 212 KB, the shot in `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-phase0/`) and Luke’s rotj body with `--rig` (the whole rig kept, 254 joints with fingers, face and physics; LOD2 706 KB, LOD4 236 KB; drawn in its bind pose).
- **Phase 1, the heroes on the game's skeleton, with their hilts** (this PR, `claude/bf2017-phase1`):
  - `public/models/galaxy/bf2017/walrus.glb`: `Walrus_HumanMale` whole, 254 nodes (`scripts/bf2017-skeleton.mjs`); `src/lib/three/walrusRig.js` names its body, fingers and sockets, `WEAPON_FRAME` (the identity: the game models weapons in the `Wep_Root` frame).
  - The game's clips as packs (`scripts/bf2017-clips.mjs`, names mapped by `src/lib/three/walrusClips.js`): `clips-humanoid.glb` 843 KB (27 clips), and one a hero: Luke 1,323 KB (45), Vader 1,269 (42), Obi-Wan 1,069 (39), Anakin 1,187 (38), Maul 1,179 (41), Dooku 1,153 (38), Palpatine 459 (15), Han, Leia, Lando, Chewbacca, Boba Fett, Bossk 92-141 KB (their defeat and abilities). 24 fps, root motion off `AITrajectory` into `extras.root`, `contact` timed on a blade a metre up `Wep_Root`, rest-holding channels left out and put back by the loader. Luke's blocks come from the cinematic skeleton (`Walrus_NIS_S0800_Skeleton`, the same rig at the same rest).
  - `src/lib/three/walrus.js` loads a 2017 body with its packs; footScene's `walrusFigure` wraps it in the same `rigged()` every figure gets, the animator told `library: false`. Both figure paths (`crew.js`, `loadPartyFigure`) take `rig: 'walrus'`.
  - Thirteen heroes at the game's full fidelity, at the owner's ask (2026-10-10, "highest fidelity"): LOD0 meshes (31,807-61,764 triangles), every map at 2048, WebP 90, 4.8-14.0 MB a file, loaded at high and ultra; a `.lod1` (the cut under 8,000 body triangles, 1024 colour, 512 maps, 1.2-2.8 MB) at low and mid. Sheets in `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-phase1/`. They are `public/models/galaxy/bf2017/crew/<kind>.glb`, credited `bf2017-<kind>`; the Meshy and Sketchfab files at `galaxy/crew/` stay, as the universe's foot party, the Death Star's people, `scripts/motion/bake.mjs`, `ual-bake.mjs` and `meshy-actions.mjs` load them as Meshy figures.
  - Ten hilts and three hero blasters, `--keep-origin`, at the game's own maps; `HILTS` wear them; the saber and gunplay put the weapon in `Wep_Root` on a 2017 figure, the clip's arms and fingers holding it, the aim on the chest.

## Left

In order:

1. **Phase 2, everyone the game has**: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phase2-everyone.md` (troopers, droids, blasters on the same loader; the humanoid pack plus the `AI_Rifleman`, `AI_Officer`, `Cover` and `Awareness` sets).
2. **Yoda and Grievous**: their own rigs (`Yoda_01_Ske`, `GeneralGrievous_01_Ske`) and clips (101 and 161); not imported this phase, they stay as they were until their own-rig packs (phase 10's).
3. **Site clip names the game has nothing for**, which fall back (`CLIP_FALLBACK`, else the humanoid pack's): Vader `sword.dash`, `sword.pound`, `force.push`; Anakin's staggers (the humanoid flinches stand in); Dooku `sword.aerial.a`, `sword.uppercut`; Palpatine every stroke (he fights with lightning in the game); the blaster heroes' dodges.
4. **Textures not in the bucket yet**: Leia's braids (`t_lodcaps_braids_01_brown_cm`, `…_n`), and the game's generic eye map (`T_Eye_MP_DA`): the human heroes wear Luke's eye map, its white lifted. Re-import when the upload has them.
5. **A dual stance on a 2017 figure** holds one hilt: the game's heroes don't dual-wield; `Wep2_Root` is there for it if the site wants one.
6. **Repository weight**: the full-fidelity heroes are 111 MB of GLBs (their light cuts 25 MB more). Lane S (`site-assets` bucket, `scripts/assets-publish.mjs`) is where they should move.
7. Phases 3 to 10 as the spec's table orders them.
8. `WEAPON_FRAME` re-measured if a weapon sits wrong; the hilt sheet and the duel shots say it doesn't.

## Checking it

The keys: `SUPABASE_URL` and `BF2017_KEY` (a key that can read the private `bf2017-assets` bucket) in `.env.local`, never committed; the owner holds them. In a cloud session they are already environment variables (the key as `SUPA_KEY`; the fetch takes either), so drop `--env-file`.

```
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs manifest
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs --list 'gameplay/equipment/heroes/*'
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs gameplay/equipment/heroes/lightsaberlukeskywalker/lightsaberlukeskywalker_meshp_mesh
node scripts/bf2017-import.mjs gameplay/equipment/heroes/lightsaberlukeskywalker/lightsaberlukeskywalker_meshp_mesh --kind hiltluke --as 'Luke’s lightsaber hilt' --asis --tex 512 --maps 256
npx vite --port 5188 --strictPort --host 127.0.0.1 &
node scripts/glb-shot.mjs public/models/galaxy/surface/hiltluke.glb /tmp/hiltluke.png three
```

Phase 1's, with the dev server up:

```
node scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs anims
node scripts/bf2017-clips.mjs luke
node scripts/bf2017-import.mjs characters/hero/luke/luke_rotj_01/luke_rotj_01_mesh --kind luke --as 'Luke Skywalker' --rig --crew --hero --metres 1.72 --parts '<head>,<hair>' --tex 2048 --maps 2048 --quality 90 --cuts plain=0,lod1=2 --eyes characters/heads/_shared/eyes/t_eyes_luke_c.ktx2
node scripts/bf2017-skeleton.mjs public/models/galaxy/bf2017/crew/luke.glb
```

The duel: open `#/galaxy/hoth/surface` as Luke, then `__surfaceDo('duel', 'maul', { stance: 'double' })` in the console; F strikes, C blocks.

The tests need no keys and no network: `npx vitest run scripts/lib/bf2017-* scripts/lib/rig-parts.test.mjs scripts/lib/catalog-write.test.mjs scripts/bf2017-import.test.mjs scripts/bf2017-clips.test.mjs scripts/bf2017-skeleton.test.mjs src/lib/three/walrus src/lib/combat/hiltFit.test.js src/components/galaxy/surface/catalog`.
