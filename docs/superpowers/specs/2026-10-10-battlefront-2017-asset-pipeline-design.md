# The Star Wars galaxy on Battlefront II (2017) assets. The design

Date: 2026-10-10. Status: **design, revised with the owner's answers of 2026-10-10, awaiting the nod to plan**, written by an architecting session from the owner's brief and a count of the Supabase buckets; implementation sessions follow, one phase each. The evidence is `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-assets/` (`inventory.md` has every number this page cites). The plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phase0-tools.md`, `-phase1-heroes.md`, `-phase2-everyone.md` and `-phaseS-streaming.md` (a lane beside the others); later phases get theirs as they start.

## What the owner asked

"We are uploading the Star Wars textures and assets to our Supabase, both raw and compressed. Check what is added. There should be a 2017 edition and a classic edition; classic is less quality. I want to use the 2017 textures and everything to improve the Star Wars world: check how we can improve it with all the models, animations and textures coming from Supabase to make it perfect. There is lightsaber combat and everything. We have all permissions; this is a small, localized, protected project (will be)." And, while the count ran: "animation is coming, don't worry, it takes time for everything to come; same with audio and meshes."

## What is on Supabase today

The short version; `inventory.md` has the long one.

- **`bf2017-assets`** (private): 103,835 objects, 2.3 GB, still uploading. Three parts:
  - `web/models/` and `web/collision/`: 46,000 GLBs. Each is `gltfpack` output (meshopt + quantization: the site's own decoder reads it), metal-rough materials, **textures referenced by relative path into `web/textures/`, not embedded**, so a model is small (Luke 265 KB at LOD0, a hilt 13 KB, the AT-AT 1.4 MB) and draws nothing until its textures arrive. Skinned models keep their skin; no GLB sampled carries a clip.
  - `web/models.jsonl`: the manifest, 13,871 models, each with its **LOD chain** (up to six cuts, LOD0 to LOD5, with triangles and bytes per cut), bounds in metres, skeleton and joint count, source textures, the **derived maps** the uploader makes (`__normal`, `__orm_<hash>`) and from which channels, and its collision GLB.
  - `data/`: 45,000 Frostbite EBX records as JSON. Reference only; nothing the site runs.
- **`bf2-extract`** (the classic edition): empty.
- **Still to come**, per the owner: `web/textures/` (10,455 unique maps referenced), animation, audio, more meshes.

**The owner's standing direction (2026-10-10, 02:45):** shift everything that can be shifted onto the game's assets, which are far better than what the site has. So the rule for every phase is **the game first**: wherever the game has a model, a texture, a clip or a shape, the site uses the game's, and Meshy, Sketchfab, Quaternius, the built kits and the UAL clips remain only for what the game lacks (the Mandalorian-era worlds, the wampa, the rancor, Jabba, the sarlacc, a few props). By 02:45 the bucket held 183,260 objects and 11.6 GB: every model and collision mesh, 10,106 of the 10,270 clips, 16,617 textures, every Havok physics shape, the UI's fonts and icons, and 628 MB of movies (`inventory.md`, "Update, 02:45").

**Precedence (the owner, 2026-10-10, 04:40).** For the Star Wars worlds, the 2017 game's assets, lighting and game logic come first, and work that would interfere with bringing them in is set aside: the Meshy-made casts and buildings, the Quaternius ground cover, generated sword clips, the Rapier body wired into the galaxy surface, and the Sketchfab ships are closed as PRs (branches kept) and replaced as the lanes land. What stays, for the other worlds and for later: the world generation and the infinite-worlds design, the planet-flight world, the Rapier physics library itself (`src/lib/physics/`, not wired into the galaxy surface), the Meshy and gen3d pipelines, the motion runner. A Star Wars lane that finds a competing piece of work on main or in an open PR builds on it only where it is not about assets, lighting or combat logic (the war's rules, the shared world, the asset mirror); otherwise it says so in its hand-off and the check-in raises it.

Three facts shape everything below.

1. **The models are already cut for the web, at six levels.** The site's importers simplify a model to a budget; here the uploader's LOD chain already holds a cut for every quality level, from a 31,000-triangle Vader to a 337-triangle one. The importer's job is to *pick*, not to simplify.
2. **The people share one rig, with fingers, and the game's clips are on it.** 604 of the 930 skinned models are on `Walrus_HumanMale`, 250 joints whose bone names are Maya HumanIK's (`Hips`, `Spine`, `Spine1`, `LeftArm`, `LeftForeArm`, `LeftHand`, `LeftHandIndex1`…). 4,498 of the game's clips are on that same rig, one glTF per clip with the bones named: a hero's whole combat set (six strikes and their returns, blocks, staggers, dodges, the dash, the jump attack, the Force powers, the defeat) and locomotion in eight directions, plus the generic humanoid's deaths, hits, cover, awareness and weapon stances. No retarget, no bake: the clip plays on the body as it is.
3. **The set is the whole game.** Every original- and prequel-trilogy hero, every trooper, every vehicle, the hilts, the blasters, and whole kits for Hoth, Endor, Tatooine, Yavin, the Death Star interior, Naboo, Kashyyyk, Kamino, Bespin and Scarif: most of the galaxy's seventeen worlds: not the three Mandalorian ones (nevarro, mandalore, sorgan), not Lothal or Coruscant, and Dagobah and Mustafar only through the forest and volcanic nature sets. The sequel era is there too (2,324 models) and stays out by the standing rule.

## Where the site is today

Read from the code (the map is in the session's notes; file references below are the ones a reader needs).

- The seventeen landable worlds are `galaxy/surface/sites/*.js`; each world's people are `life` entries by kind. A kind is drawn, in order, as a `CREW` figure on Meshy's 24-bone skeleton (`crewList.js`, rigged people with the shared baked clips), else a catalogue model (`catalog/*.js`: a statue, or a rig with its own clips, or legs found at run time), else a built figure.
- The catalogue is 25 groups of kinds; `battlefront.js` (ten troopers from the 2005 game's remaster, with Harrisonfog's permission) comes last and overrides. Models are `public/models/galaxy/surface/<kind>.glb` with optional `.lod1.glb` and `.ultra.glb`; crew are `galaxy/crew/<kind>.glb`; rigged troopers `galaxy/troops/`.
- Budgets per quality level (`src/lib/budgets.js`): low 0.8M triangles, 350 calls, 20 MB of models; mid 1.5M / 500 / 40; high 3M / 700 / 60; ultra unlimited / 1,500 / 240. Texture caps (`lib/detail.js`): 512, 1024, 4096, 8192. File caps (`catalog.test.js`): 2.5 MB per surface GLB, 4 MB for a `hero`, `.lod1` under 0.7× the plain file, `.ultra` under 24 MB.
- Every GLB is meshopt; textures are WebP, with KTX2 only where it pays (normals, and the ultra planet maps). `lib/three/gltf.js` loads the KTX2 decoder lazily when a model needs it.
- **Lightsaber combat** (`surface/saber.js`, `combatRules.js`, `lib/combat/*`): the hilt is procedural (`gunplay.js`'s `GUNS.saber` dressed by `heroes.js`'s `HILTS`), the blade is an unlit core and sleeve under bloom, the strokes are 31 UAL2 `Sword_*` clips baked onto the Meshy rig, with `contact` and `root` extras. The saber-forms lane (`HANDOFF-saber-forms.md`) has not run: no forms, no Force, no dismemberment; its lane 0 was five gen3d hilt requests, and the handoff says the hilt stays procedural "until gen3d hilts land".
- What the earlier lanes left wanting (`HANDOFF-galaxy-asset-upgrade.md`, `HANDOFF-combat.md`, `HANDOFF-galactic-assault.md`, the Hoth spec): twenty-four humanoid kinds still statues or boxes; the seventeen beasts sway; the 2005 troopers stand at bind pose in the assault; the B1 reads grey; Endor is over its triangle budget; no finger bones anywhere (`docs/decisions/2026-10-08-fingers-on-the-meshy-skeleton.md` says revisit "if a free rigger gives fingers"); hilts and blasters are boxes.

The 2017 drop answers most of that list directly: real hilts and blasters, rigged people with fingers, every beast with its own rig, modular kits for the worlds that are built from boxes, and six-level LOD chains for the budget.

## The owner's answers, and what stays open

Asked on 2026-10-10 and answered the same day. Where the answer was "I don't know", the design keeps its reading and says how the tools find out instead of asking again.

1. **Licence and the gate: deploy as today.** The permission is recorded as a decision entry; every imported model is credited as EA DICE's, "used with permission on this non-commercial fan project", the way Harrisonfog's are. No gate in this design.
2. **The clips' shape: not known yet.** The design's animation path assumes files on the `Walrus_HumanMale` rig (GLBs with `animations`, or one file per clip), which is what an extraction from the same game gives. Until they land, the site's own clips drive the 2017 people by bone name (section "Animation"); the clip importer is the last phase and is written against what actually arrives.
3. **Raw PNG beside the KTX2: probably.** The fetch script asks the bucket per texture and takes PNG when it is there, KTX2 unpacked with `basisu -unpack` when it is not; the import never needs to know which.
4. **The classic edition: not known.** Its bucket is empty. If it fills with `.msh` and `.tga` from the 2005 game, `battlefront-import.mjs` is its importer and nothing here changes; if with something else, it gets its own short design then. Nothing in this design depends on it.
5. **The rig: the 2017 one, whole.** The owner's words: "use 2017's, it's way more in depth and can do cool lightsaber fights and animations", and then: "use the 2017 rig in full, it's more robust; ignore Meshy, this is full game files." So: no pruning, no renaming of bones to Meshy's, no transfer. Every 2017 person keeps all of `Walrus_HumanMale` (the 250 joints: body, fingers, rolls, physics helpers, weapon sockets, procedural bones), and the site learns the game's skeleton (section 4). Meshy's library and skeleton stay for the figures that are not from the game.
6. **Phase order: people and characters first, then vehicles, then worlds.** The hilts and blasters go with the people, since they are what the people hold. Section 5 is in that order.

## The approaches weighed

**A. Fetch at run time from Supabase.** Serve the bucket's GLBs and KTX2 straight to the browser through signed URLs. Rejected: the standing rule is no run-time asset service and no key in the client (`.claude/skills/autopilot/SKILL.md`, the Supabase decision entry); the bucket's cuts are not the site's budgets; and 10,455 KTX2 files at the uploader's sizes are far past the per-world download the site allows.

**B. Import by hand, model by model, through `battlefront-import.mjs`.** The 2005 path, extended to read these GLBs. Rejected as the main path: it re-simplifies what is already cut, re-encodes textures the uploader already packed, and knows nothing of the manifest's LOD chain, collision or derived maps. It is kept as the classic edition's importer.

**C. A manifest-driven importer, fetched ahead, committed, credited (recommended).** A fetch script pulls a model and everything the manifest says it needs into the git-ignored `lab/assets/bf2017/`; an import script turns the manifest's LOD chain into the site's cuts (`.lod1`, plain, `.ultra`), re-encodes textures to the site's formats and caps, grounds and orients the model the way every surface model is, writes the catalogue row and the credit; the worlds then wear the kinds. One recipe, run per kind, so each phase is a list of kinds and a check, and nothing is downloaded by a visitor that is not committed.

The rest of this page is C.

## The design

### 1. Licence and credit (phase 0)

- A decision entry `docs/decisions/2026-10-10-battlefront-2017-assets.md`: the source (EA DICE's Star Wars Battlefront II, 2017, extracted by the owner), the permission the owner holds, the non-commercial and gated nature of the project, what is excluded (the sequel era, by the existing rule), and that every model is credited.
- Credits: a new `made: 'bf2017'` value in the catalogue (the test's allowed list gains it) and one `modelCredits.json` row per kind, `license: 'permission'` with the permission text, `author` "EA DICE", `source` the game, `where` the bucket path of the LOD0 file. `scripts/credits.mjs` already lists "used with permission" models in their own section; `CREDITS.md` is regenerated.
- `docs/assets/battlefront-2017.md`: where the drop lives, how to fetch, how to credit, the texture packing (from `inventory.md`), the rig's bone names. It joins `quaternius.md` and `colliders.md`.

### 2. The fetch (`scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs`)

```
node scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs manifest                       # web/models.jsonl → lab/assets/bf2017/models.jsonl
node scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs <name> [--lod all|0|2…] [--textures] [--collision]
node scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs --list 'characters/hero/luke/*'   # what the manifest holds under a glob
```

- Reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `BF2017_KEY` from `.env.local` (never committed; `.env.example` gains the names). The key is a service key or a bucket-scoped one the owner makes; the bucket stays private. No key is printed.
- Resolves a model through the manifest: its LOD files, the textures its GLBs reference (parsed from each GLB's `images[].uri`, since the manifest lists source maps and the GLB lists the derived ones), its collision GLB. Writes them under `lab/assets/bf2017/` in the bucket's own layout so the GLBs' relative URIs resolve on disk.
- Raw PNGs first when the bucket holds them (assumption 3), else the KTX2.
- Uses Node's `fetch`; no new dependency, so no stack page. `bf2017-fetch.test.mjs` tests the manifest lookup and the URI parsing against a fixture (the 13 KB hilt from `test/`), no network.

### 3. The import (`scripts/bf2017-import.mjs`)

```
node scripts/bf2017-import.mjs <manifest name> --kind <kind> --as '<what it is>'
    [--metres 1.83 | --asis] [--yaw 0] [--rig] [--crew] [--hero] [--ultra]
    [--cuts lod1=<n>,plain=<n>,ultra=0] [--tex 1024] [--maps 512] [--parts <glob>…] [--grip <node>]
```

One kind in, the site's files out, the way `battlefront-import.mjs` does, but from the manifest:

- **Cuts from the chain, not from simplification.** Default picks, by the LOD whose triangles fit: `.lod1.glb` ≤ 2,500 (LOD3 or LOD4), plain ≤ 12,000 for a prop or 8,000 for a person (LOD1 or LOD2), `.ultra.glb` LOD0 (only with `--ultra`, and under the 24 MB cap). `--cuts` overrides. A model whose chain has no fit is simplified by `surface-model.mjs`'s `simplified` as today, and the import says so.
- **Parts.** A composite (vehicles, a hero's cape and hands as separate GLBs) is assembled from the manifest's siblings named by `--parts` (globs over the folder) into one file, each part at the same LOD. Frostbite's "donotuse", "frontend", "wreck" and "cutscene" variants are skipped unless named.
- **Textures to the site's formats.** From PNG (or unpacked KTX2): colour to WebP at `--tex` (1024 default; 2048 for `--ultra`), the orm map rebuilt from the manifest's `derived` recipe (roughness = 1 − smoothness alpha; occlusion and metal from the channels it names) to WebP at `--maps`, normals to KTX2 UASTC at `--tex` where the research rule holds (GPU memory down, bytes within 1.25×, 34 dB kept: `scripts/ktx2.mjs` already measures that) and WebP otherwise. Materials keep the GLB's own metal-rough setup; `extras.shader` and `extras.textures` are dropped before writing.
- **Grounded and oriented** by `surface-model.mjs` (upright, facing +z, standing on y = 0, `--metres` along y; `--asis` keeps the manifest's metres, which are right for everything sampled).
- **Rigs.** Without `--rig` the skin is dropped and the model is a statue (vehicles, props, beasts until their clips come). With `--rig` (every person, hero and trooper) the skin and every joint are kept exactly as they come: the game's skeleton is the contract its clips, sockets and physics bones are written against, and anything removed would have to be put back when the game's clips land. `--crew` writes to `galaxy/crew/<kind>.glb` and prints the `CREW` row (`crewList.js`: a file and a height, plus `rig: 'walrus'` so the loader knows); otherwise `galaxy/surface/<kind>.glb` and the catalogue row go into a new `catalog/bf2017.js`, which joins `GROUPS` after `battlefront` so it overrides.
- **Grip and muzzle** named inside the file (`--grip`, defaulting to the manifest's `Wep_Root` for a weapon, `IK_Joint_RightHand` for a person), the way colliders are named, so `held.js`'s `holdItem` and the saber's stroke have a real point to hold instead of an inferred axis (the combat handoff's open item).
- **Sockets, not guesses.** The game's rig carries named sockets: `Wep_Root` (the weapon's root in the right hand), `Wep_Muzzle`, `Wep_Aim`, `IK_Joint_LeftHand` and `IK_Joint_RightHand`. The import leaves them in place; the site's hold, bolt origin and second hand use them (section 4), so a hilt or blaster sits where the game put it and no `GRIP_FIX` row is guessed.
- **Collision.** With `--collision`, the manifest's collision GLB is merged in as a `_physical` node with a `trimesh` child (`docs/assets/colliders.md`), so the durable world's structures and the Death Star interior's walls get walkable collision for free.
- **Credit and catalogue row** written as in section 1. The import refuses a sequel-era path (a list of folder names from `inventory.md`) with a one-line reason.

`bf2017-import.test.mjs` runs the hilt fixture end to end (a 13 KB GLB and three 64² PNGs committed under `scripts/fixtures/bf2017/`): cuts chosen as the table says, textures at the asked sizes, grip node present, credit row shaped as `catalog.test.js` wants. Under a second, no network.

### 4. Animation

The game's clips drive the game's people. Nothing is baked from the site's libraries onto a 2017 figure.

- **One skeleton, many bodies, the game's clips.** All 604 humanoids share `Walrus_HumanMale` with one bind pose, and the game's 4,498 humanoid clips are glTF animations on that skeleton's node names (`inventory.md`, "The clips"). A clip plays on any 2017 body by name; a body with a few extra bones (a cape's physics) rests on the ones no clip names.
- **Clip packs, not per-figure bakes.** `scripts/bf2017-clips.mjs` reads `web/anims.jsonl`, takes the clips a pack names, resamples to 24 fps where the site's animator wants it, measures `contact`, `root` and `rootHips` the way `ual-bake` does (its `contactWindow` and `rootTravel` are exported), meshopt-compresses, and writes one GLB per pack under `public/models/galaxy/bf2017/`: `clips-humanoid.glb` (the generic set every 2017 person shares: idle, walk, run, sprint, turns, crouch, the deaths and hits, the rifle and pistol stances, cover) and `clips-<hero>.glb` per hero (its `A_<Hero>_*` combat set and `C_<Hero>_*` locomotion). A pack is a skeleton with animations and no mesh; a hero pack lands near 1 MB compressed (Luke's 69 combat clips are 7.5 MB raw).
- **The names the site asks for.** A pure, tested map (`src/lib/three/walrusClips.js`) turns each name the combat rules and the AI already use into the game's clip for a role: `sword.light.a` → `A_<Hero>_AttackLoop_Strike1`, `sword.block` → `A_<Hero>_Stand_Block_SwingRight_01` (or the hero's `Block_Stagger` when it has no block), `sword.dash` → `A_<Hero>_Stand_SaberDash_01`, `sword.aerial.a` → `A_<Hero>_Jump_SaberAttack_Light_FH_01`, `die` → `A_<Hero>_Defeated_01`, `hit.chest` → `A_<Hero>_Stagger_Front_01`, `walk` → `C_<Hero>_Stand_Walk_Fwd_01`, and for the generic humanoid `die.fwd` → `A_HM_Death_Stand_Front_*`, `aim.pistol` → the pistol stance, and so on. `combatRules.js`, `react.js` and `activity.js` do not change: they ask for `sword.block` and get Vader's. The `_V2` strikes and the `_BackToIdle` returns give the forms lane its variants without mirroring.
- **A loader that knows the rig** (`src/lib/three/walrus.js`, over a pure `walrusRig.js`): the bones the game's skeleton must have, the sockets by name (`Wep_Root`, `Wep_Muzzle`, `Wep_Aim`, `IK_Joint_{Left,Right}Hand`), a check that says what is missing, tracks filtered to the bones a body has, the fallback for a name a pack lacks (`CLIP_FALLBACK`). `crew.js` sends a `rig: 'walrus'` row through it and gets back the same figure object every other loader returns, so `actors.js`, `activity.js`, the duellists and the saber keep their calls.
- **The site's bone lists** that name Meshy's spine (`saber.js`'s `ARMS`) gain the game's names (`Spine1`, `Spine2`, `Neck`); `actors.js`'s Meshy check stays false for a 2017 figure, which is right.
- **Fingers** move with the game's clips; the hilt parents to `Wep_Root`; no `GRIP_FIX` row is guessed.
- **Other rigs** (Yoda 101 clips, Grievous 161, B1 532, B2 337, droideka 52, tauntaun 44, AT-ST 69, AT-TE 41, Ewok 77, BB-8 88): the same loader with the rig's own bone list, one pack each, in the phase that ships the body. Until then the body ships as a statue.
- **The UAL and Meshy libraries** stay for the figures that are not from the game. A 2017 figure never uses them; `CLIP_FALLBACK` maps a missing name to the nearest game clip, never to a UAL one.

### 5. What each phase brings, and where it goes

Each phase is one branch and one PR, gated on `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `node scripts/health.mjs --check --skip build`, `galaxy-check.mjs surface <world>` at high under its budget row, `anim-check.mjs` for any rigged kind, and a model-sheet comparison (`scripts/preview/surface.html`, `glb-shot.mjs`) under `docs/superpowers/evidence/bf2017-<phase>/`. "Compare, never assume" stays: a 2017 model replaces a kind only when the sheet shows it better. The order is the owner's: people and characters, then vehicles, then worlds.

| phase | what | kinds (from the manifest) | replaces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | the tools and the rules: decision entry, assets page, fetch, import, tests, `made:'bf2017'`, `catalog/bf2017.js` | the fixture hilt | nothing visible |
| 1 | **the heroes, with what they hold**: the game's clip packs (generic humanoid and one per hero), the loader that knows the rig, `CREW` rows on it; the hilts in the `Wep_Root` socket and the hero blasters | luke (rotj, farmboy, hoth), vader, obiwan, anakin, maul, dooku, yoda, grievous, palpatine, han, leia, lando, chewbacca, bobafett, bossk; hilts: luke, lukehoth, vader, obiwan, anakin, maul, maulcrimson, dooku, yoda, grievous; dl44, ee3, bowcaster, the hero rifles | the Meshy crew heroes; `GUNS.saber`'s procedural hilt and `HILTS`; closes saber-forms lane 0 without gen3d |
| 2 | **everyone the game has** (`-phase2-everyone.md`): the 102 audited kinds mapped to the game's bodies, troopers, civilians (the villager becomes a pool of the game's Mos Eisley, Theed and Vardos people), officers, droids, the Ewok, the jawa, the kaminoan, on the generic humanoid pack and the own-rig packs; the far cut; the packs lazy; the cost measured on every world | stormtrooper, shadowtrooper, deathtrooper, shoretrooper, scout, sandtrooper, snowtrooper, clone legions, rebel and Hoth troopers, officers, pilots; B1, B2, droideka (own rig), astromechs, protocol, gonk, mouse, viper probe; the civilians; e11, a280, dlt19, dc15, t21, rt97c, se14c | the 2005 troopers and `troops/`, the Sketchfab droids, the box blasters; the assault's bind-pose soldiers |
| 3 | **the beasts and riders**: tauntaun (44 clips, with its rider set), dewback, bantha, the Ewok (77), each on its own pack where the game has one, a statue where it does not | tauntaun, dewback, bantha, eopie, ronto, jawa, ewok, wookiee, gamorrean, bith, aiwha, kaminoan | the Meshy and Sketchfab statues of the same |
| 4 | **ground vehicles and turrets** (lane V, `-phaseV-vehicles.md`, with 5) | atat, atst, atte, atrt, aat, mtt, hailfire, homing and dwarf spider, stap, barc, speeder bike, x34, turbo tank; e-web, df9, atgar, mark ii, turbolaser | the Sketchfab atat/atst/atte/atrt/aat and the rest |
| 5 | **air vehicles**, with their cockpits (lane V) | xwing t65, ywing, awing, uwing, tie fighter, bomber, interceptor, advanced, falcon, slave i, snowspeeder, laat, arc170, n1, vwing, vulture, tri-fighter, hyena, cloud car | the Sketchfab and gen3d fighters on the ground and the `lod/` cuts in space |
| 6 | **Hoth** (lane W, `-phaseW-worlds.md`, with 7 and 8; the `cast: 'models'` world, so every kind must resolve) and its Echo Base, under the game's Hoth sky | hangar system (110 pieces), corridor, wall, fuel silo, DF.9 stack; arctic rocks and backdrops | `echoLayout.js`'s built hangar, the Sketchfab gr75 and generator |
| 7 | **the other original-trilogy worlds**: Endor, Tatooine, Yavin, the Death Star interior | Endor: landing platform, power core room, bunker system, forest base; Tatooine: Mos Eisley (96), Jabba's palace (133), desert nature; Yavin: temple grounds, 551 nature pieces; Death Star: 216 interior pieces, tractor beam generator, debris | the built bunker and platform, the Meshy Mos Eisley and palace, the Quaternius ground cover, the code-built Death Star rooms' walls (the room layout stays; `kit.js` wears the pieces) |
| 8 | **the prequel worlds**: Naboo, Kamino, Kashyyyk, Geonosis (from `a3/`), plus Bespin and Scarif | palace, hangar, Theed facades, canal; cloning facility, domes, platforms; village, walkways, Venator wreck; upper levels, plaza; barracks, train station | the Meshy buildings (theed, tipoca, cloudcity…) |
| 9 | **ultra and the space layer**: `.ultra.glb` at LOD0 with 2048 KTX2 for heroes and vehicles; the far LODs (LOD4, LOD5) for instanced far crowds and wrecks; capital ships for the fleet war | imperial cruiser, venator, mc80, cr90; the LOD5 cuts | the `hq/` destroyer and nebulon, the `lod/` cuts |
| 10 | **the rest of the game** (lane F, `-phaseF-effects-lighting-lines.md`): the levels' HDR lightmaps and probes as the worlds' lighting and skies (9,648 files under `textures/levels/`), the Havok shapes as colliders for the durable world (`web/physics/`), the UI's fonts and icons (`web/fonts/`, `web/svg/`), the sound when it lands (ignite, hum, clash), the saber-forms lane on the game's `_V2` and blocked strikes | the procedural sky dome where a world has a probe; the synthesised saber sound; the mirrored-clip forms |

Phase 0 needs nothing from the bucket but the fixture; phase 1's inputs were all present by 02:45 (`inventory.md`). Phases 4 to 8 can run in parallel lanes once phase 2 has merged, one set per lane, the way the Hoth and Death Star lanes ran. Phase 10's sound waits on the bucket; its lighting and physics do not.

### 6. Budgets, download and performance

Measured, not guessed (`inventory.md`, "Costs measured"; phase 2's plan, task 6, re-measures on every world).

- **Per-world triangle and call rows do not move.** A world that swaps a built kit or a crowd for 2017 figures is measured before and after with `galaxy-check.mjs` under `BUDGET=1` and must stay within its row; where it would not, the world places fewer, the import takes the next LOD down, and the PR says which. Endor stays held to its own baseline.
- **Textures, per level, from the measurement**: low colour 512 WebP and the rest 256; mid colour 1024, ORM 512, normal 512, all WebP; high colour 1024, ORM 512, normal 1024, all WebP; ultra colour 2048 WebP and normal 2048 KTX2 UASTC on the `.ultra` cut only. A KTX2 normal costs ten times the WebP's bytes at the same size (Luke's: 1.9 MB against 0.48 MB for two), so below ultra the research rule keeps WebP; at ultra the GPU memory saving is what the level is for. The texture memory contract stands: at most 60 textures a world, 256 MB desktop, 128 MB phone, read from `renderer.info` and put in the evidence.
- **A person costs about 1.3 MB at high** (a LOD2 body of 0.4 to 0.5 MB and four to six maps near 1 MB), 0.6 MB at mid, 0.3 MB at low. Ten trooper kinds on Hoth are 13 MB at high: the world loads them as it does now, when near, by kind, and `WORLD_MB['/galaxy']` (10 today) is raised per phase by what was measured.
- **Cuts from the game's chain**: plain at the LOD under 8,000 triangles, `.lod1` at the LOD under 1,500 (the game's fourth cut, for a figure past the level's `near`), and a `.far` cut at the last LOD (under 700 triangles, 256 maps, under 150 KB) for the assault's squads past `mid`. A world draws the cut its distance asks for; nothing above `near` is ever the plain.
- **Draw calls**: a figure's parts are joined per material at import, so a trooper is two or three calls and a hero with a cape and hair four to six; thirty soldiers on Hoth at high are under a hundred calls of the 700.
- **Clips are packs, loaded when needed**: the generic humanoid pack (under 3 MB: constant channels dropped, camera and trajectory channels dropped, combat at 30 fps, locomotion 24, idles 15, meshopt) loads once per world when the first 2017 person is near; a hero's pack (under 2.5 MB, about 50 clips at 46 KB) loads with the hero when picked or when a duellist spawns, never with the world; an own-rig pack (B1, B2, droideka, Ewok, astromech, tauntaun) with its kind. Nothing is baked per figure.
- **Compression beyond this is not needed**: meshopt on meshes and clips, WebP on colour, KTX2 only where the level is ultra. The import refuses a file over its cap rather than squeezing it: a kind over the cap takes the next LOD or a smaller map, said in the PR.

### 7. Lightsaber combat, specifically

What the drop changes for the duel, in the order it can land:

1. **Hilts** (phase 1, with the heroes): the real models, 920 triangles, with a grip node; the blade's root sits on the hilt's emitter instead of the procedural cylinder's top. `heroes.js`'s `HILTS` rows name a kind; `saber.js`'s `createSaber` wears the kind's GLB in place of the drum `gunplay.js`'s `GUNS.saber` builds, and keeps that drum, recoloured by `dress()`, for a hero without one.
2. **Hands that hold** (phase 1): the hilt sits in the game's `Wep_Root` socket with the game's orientation, the second hand's target is `IK_Joint_LeftHand`, and the fingers are the clip's; the combat handoff's "sword axis inferred" item closes.
3. **Duellists that look right** (phase 1): Vader, Luke, Obi-Wan, Maul, Dooku, Yoda, Grievous at the game's quality, facing the player.
4. **The game's strokes** (phase 1, they are here): each hero's own six strikes and their `_V2` variants, blocks that swing left and right, blocked-strike reactions, staggers, dodges, the dash, the jump attack, the Force push and repulse, the catch and the defeat, with `contact` measured so the blade-to-blade contact rule keeps working. The duel reads like the game's because it is the game's.
5. **Sound**, when the audio lands: ignite, hum, clash by kind, the Force sounds the saber-forms design listed, through `sounds.js` in place of the synthesised `saber()`. That is a small lane of its own when the files are there, and this design only reserves the names.

The saber FX (`saberFx.js`, bloom, trail, sparks) and the rules (`lib/combat/*`) are not touched by this design; they are the saber-forms lane's.

### 8. Rules this design keeps

- No run-time call to a service that makes anything; every asset is fetched ahead, imported and credited, and then either committed or published to the site's own public bucket by content hash with its manifest committed (section 10, the one exception to the standing rule, recorded in the decision entry). The private bucket's key lives in `.env.local` only; the public bucket needs none.
- A dependency has a page before its import (`RULES.md`). This design adds none: fetch is Node's, textures go through `sharp` and `basisu` the site already holds, GLBs through `@gltf-transform`.
- Scripts under `scripts/`, pure logic in tested files beside them, files under 800 lines; `catalog/bf2017.js` splits by world when it nears the limit, behind a barrel, like the others.
- One art style per world: a world that takes 2017 pieces declares `scanned` in its `look.js`, and takes them for its people, buildings and vehicles together, not one of three, so `art-mix` does not count it.
- No sequel-era model, place or name (the import refuses the paths).
- Compare on the model sheet before replacing; put the sheets in evidence.

### 10. Streaming, both ways: the bucket to the pipeline, and the site to the bucket

The owner's direction (2026-10-10, 03:30): make the Supabase-to-game streaming robust, and make the site's loading from Supabase robust and performant on devices. The plan is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phaseS-streaming.md`; it is its own lane and runs beside phases 1 and 2.

**What changes in the rules, and why.** The standing rule is "no run-time call to an asset service; every asset is committed and served from the static site". Its purpose is that nothing a visitor sees depends on a paid service that makes things, and that no secret leaks. A public, read-only bucket of the site's *finished* files, served through Supabase's CDN with immutable cache headers, is a static host, the way GitHub Pages is: it makes nothing, it holds no secret (the anon read is the point), and the site falls back to its own origin when the bucket's URL is not set. What the rule still forbids stands: no raw game file is ever served, no key is in the client, nothing is generated or converted in the browser. The decision entry of phase 0 records this exception and its reason: eleven gigabytes of game-derived files cannot live in a git repository or a Pages deploy, and the site is better for being able to use them.

**The bucket to the pipeline** (`scripts/bf2017-fetch.mjs`, phase 0's, made robust):
- Every download goes to a `.part` file and is renamed when complete, so a cut-off run leaves no half file; a file whose bytes match the manifest's is kept, so a run resumes.
- A pool of six concurrent fetches; each with a timeout of 30 s plus a second per megabyte; a failure (network, 429, 5xx, a short body) retried three times with waits of 1, 2 and 4 s, honouring `Retry-After`; a 404 is `missing` (the upload has not reached it), not a failure.
- `--all '<glob>'` fetches a whole set with one summary line (fetched, kept, missing, failed, bytes, seconds) and exits 1 only on a failure, never on a `missing`; `--verify` re-reads sizes against the manifest and refetches a mismatch. A local index (`lab/assets/bf2017/.index.json`: path, bytes, when) makes a second pass cheap.
- The pure pieces (the pool, the backoff schedule, the part-rename, the summary) are tested; the network is not.

**The site to the bucket** (a new bucket, `site-assets`, public, read-only):
- **What goes there**: the files the pipeline makes from the game (crew and surface GLBs, the clip packs, the ultra cuts), named by content hash (`models/galaxy/crew/luke.<hash8>.glb`), uploaded by `scripts/assets-publish.mjs` with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and the right content type, skipping any hash the bucket already holds. Nothing raw; nothing from Meshy, Sketchfab or Quaternius moves (those stay committed and served as today until the game's replace them).
- **What the repo holds instead of the files**: a manifest `src/data/galaxyAssets.json` (`{ "<site path>": { hash, bytes, from, tier } }`), written by the publish script and committed; the files themselves are git-ignored by the same rule (`scripts/assets-ignore.mjs` keeps `.gitignore`'s block in step with the manifest). Credits stay in `modelCredits.json`. Tests that today `stat` a file (`catalog.test.js`'s caps) read the manifest's `bytes` when the file is absent, so CI needs no download; the model sheets fetch what they show.
- **How the site resolves a path** (`src/lib/net/assetUrl.js`, pure): `assetUrl(path, { base = import.meta.env.VITE_ASSET_BASE, manifest }) → string`: the bucket's hashed URL when `base` is set and the path is in the manifest, else the path on the site's own origin. One line to point the site at another host (Cloudflare R2, where egress is free, if Supabase's becomes the cost: Pro includes 250 GB a month, and a visit to Hoth at high is about 25 MB, so roughly ten thousand such visits).
- **The loader, made robust and device-aware** (`src/lib/net/assetFetch.js`, used by `lib/three/gltf.js` and `textures.js`):
  - a pool by tier (two fetches at once on a weak device or a saver connection, three on a phone, six on a desktop, eight at ultra) with a priority queue: the thing nearest the visitor first, a picked hero's pack ahead of the world's props;
  - a timeout of 20 s plus a second per megabyte; a failure retried three times with 0.5, 1 and 2 s waits; a 429 honouring `Retry-After`; one in-flight request per URL;
  - every world's fetches under one `AbortController`, aborted by its dispose, so leaving a world stops its downloads at once;
  - **progressive figures**: a person's `.lod1` (a tenth of the plain) is fetched and shown first, the plain swapped in when it arrives; past the near distance the swap never happens, which is the far cut's whole saving;
  - a fallback ladder that never hangs: the plain fails → the `.lod1` → the kind's previous figure (Meshy, Sketchfab, built) → nothing drawn and one warning in development;
  - the HUD's loading line reads bytes from the pool ("Loading Hoth, 12 of 27 MB"), and `WorldGate`'s install uses the same URLs, so an installed world is served offline by the service worker from the bucket's files (`public/sw.js`'s "no other origin" rule admits the one asset origin `packs/index.json` names).
- **Checks**: `scripts/assets-check.mjs` HEADs every manifest URL (200, `content-length` equal to `bytes`, the cache header present) and runs before deploy; `scripts/stream-check.mjs` opens Hoth through Playwright on a phone profile with a throttled 3G connection and measures time to the first figure, the bytes before the world is walkable, retries seen, and console errors, against numbers the plan sets and `galaxy-check.mjs` keeps.

### 11. Fidelity: everything, in depth, at what a laptop can run, streamed

The owner's direction (2026-10-10, 03:40): every hero, vehicle, effect and line, implemented in depth, at the highest visual fidelity a laptop can carry, streamed. The lanes are `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-bf2017-phaseV-vehicles.md`, `-phaseW-worlds.md` and `-phaseF-effects-lighting-lines.md`, beside phases 1, 2 and S.

**The bar.** The laptop is the target device: `lib/device` puts a modern laptop at `high` (a discrete or recent integrated GPU) and a gaming laptop at `ultra` through `gpuGrade`. So every category below ships its `high` cut as the default look and its `ultra` cut for the stronger laptop, both streamed (section 10), and `low` and `mid` remain the phone's. "In depth" means: the model, its own clips, its cockpit or rider seat, its effects, its sound and lines when the game's audio lands, and its destruction where the game has one, not a model standing in for all of that. "Highest fidelity" is bounded by the measured budgets of section 6: a laptop at `high` holds 3M triangles and 700 calls a world; `ultra` holds 240 MB of models. Where the game's `ultra` look would break a row, the plan says which LOD or map size gives the row back, and the sheet decides.

**What each category takes from the game** (`inventory.md`):

- **Heroes**: phase 1. Their outfits by world (Luke Hoth on Hoth, Han Endor on Endor, Leia Boushh at Jabba's) as alternate crew rows picked by the site (`outfit` on a `life` entry), their own hilts and blasters, their own full clip sets, their abilities' poses (`Stand_ForceAttack_Push`, `ForceChoke`, `MindTrick`, `RagePowerUp`) for the powers the saber-forms design lists.
- **Vehicles** (lane V): the walkers on the game's rigs with the game's clips (AT-ST 69 clips, AT-AT 39 including the tow-cable deaths and a destruction set, AT-TE 41, AT-RT 31, AT-M6 22, droideka 52) through the own-rig loader; every fighter with its cockpit mesh (X-wing, Y-wing, A-wing, TIE fighter, bomber, interceptor, Advanced, the Falcon, Slave I, the snowspeeder, LAAT, ARC-170, N-1) so the space layer and the rides have the game's interior; the speeders, turrets and the Hoth tow cable rope rig. The site's rides (`rides`, the chase, the walker battle) take the game's models under the same ride rules.
- **Worlds** (lane W): each world's kit (section 5's phases 6 to 8) on the game's pieces, with the game's per-level HDR sky and light probes as the world's environment (the galaxy has no image sky today: `sky.js` is a shader dome). The game's lightmaps are baked for its own layouts and are not reusable; its skies and probes are.
- **Effects** (lane F): the game's effect meshes (317: laser beams, force fields, heat haze, clouds, the Death Star's internal beam) and effect textures (378 in the manifest: bolts, impacts, sparks, smoke, flipbooks; 11 up at 03:40, more coming) as the *look* of the site's own effect systems (`fx.sparks`, the bolt pool, the saber trail, `saberFx.js`), since Frostbite's effect graphs do not export. Blaster bolts, impacts on each surface, saber clash, ignition, the Force push's ring, engine glow, thruster trails, explosions by vehicle, snow and sand kicked up by feet and treads.
- **Lighting**: not this design's (above): the game's sky and probe HDRs per level are published for the owner's lighting lane, which lights the worlds with three.js separately.
- **Lines and sound**: the game's audio has not landed (`data/Sound` is records only). When it does: the heroes' lines, the troopers' barks, the saber's ignite, hum, swing and clash, the blasters by weapon, the vehicles' engines and footfalls, through `sounds.js` and `clips.js` under the same names the site uses, replacing the synthesised and generated ones. Until then the site's own stand.
- **Cinematics** (116 WebM): catalogued, not used; the front door could show one on a strong connection, but that is the owner's call and not in any lane.
- **UI fonts and icons**: not used (licensed fonts, and the site has its own).

**Textures (the owner, 2026-10-10, 04:40): the game's, for everything, and no pre-existing set.** In a Star Wars world every map a visitor sees comes from the 2017 drop: the people's, the vehicles', the kits', and also the **ground, trim and prop materials** that today come from the site's photo scans (`public/cc0/galaxy/<role>/`, Poly Haven, through `galaxy-textures.mjs`'s roles and `core.js`'s `wear`/`dress`), the Death Star's ambientCG walls (`hq-assets.json`), the Quaternius and kit materials, and the generator's atlases. The roles stay as the code's interface (snow, sand, rock, metal, tiles…); each role's files are re-sourced from the game's tiling terrain and trim maps (`textures/levels/mp/<world>_01/…terrain…`, `objects/architecture/<world>/_shared`, `objects/nature/<set>`, the Death Star's `deathstar_interior` panels) by `scripts/bf2017-textures.mjs`, and the catalogue's `detail`/`detailLook` scan overlays are never set on a `bf2017` row. A Star Wars world that still reads a file under `public/cc0/galaxy/`, `public/hq/tex/` or `public/games/tex/` fails `galaxy-check`'s texture census once lane W has reached it.

**Lighting, physics, camera and GUI are other lanes' (the owner, 04:40).** The owner's own sessions add the lighting with three.js, the physics, the camera and the GUI separately. This design's lanes do not build any of them: lane W does not write a level-sky loader and lane F has no lighting task; instead the lanes **publish the game's sky and probe HDRs per level** (as assets with a manifest line naming the level and the arena) for the lighting lane to consume, leave the saber's and bolts' light sources as they are, and keep every hook those lanes need (a figure's `sockets`, a vehicle's `seat` and `muzzle`, a kit piece's `_physical` collider node from the game's collision mesh) in the files, documented in the hand-off.

**Not in depth, by rule**: nothing of the sequel era; nothing the game does not have (section 5's "stays" list).

### 12. The other designs on the same export (2026-10-10, 05:40), and what they take over

Three designs from the owner's other sessions, written against the desktop export (which holds parts the bucket count could not see), take over parts of this one. The owner's rule is the game first, so where they draw from the game's own data, they win.

| design | what it found | what it takes over from this page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PR #810, the galaxy on the game's levels, under its light, with its planets and sabers | 74 level layouts with 873,000 placed instances and transforms, 39 heightmaps, 10,530 Havok shape sets, 192 VisualEnvironment lighting records with probes, 102 planet skins; no lightmaps exist (Enlighten runs at run time); placed lights, effect spawns and audio are not exported and need an exporter pass | **lane L** supersedes lane W (`-phaseW-worlds.md`): each world drawn from the game's level, cell-streamed, Hoth first; lane W ends with a tools-only PR (the kit merge, the roles' game textures, the skies list). **lane G** is the lighting (this page's section 11 already left it out). **lane K** the planet skins. **lane X** the sabers' stroke tables measured from the game's clips, the hold and the blade's light, on phase 1's packs and loader (phase 1 keeps the packs, the loader, the hilts and the crew rows; lane X reads them). Level textures stay the bucket's KTX2 (ETC1S colour, UASTC the rest) because GPU memory binds a whole level: section 6's WebP mix is for figures, vehicles and props, not level packs. |
| PR #817, the galaxy's physics from the game's data | `CharacterPhysicsData`, skeleton collision capsules, the ragdoll, 114 projectile and 159 vehicle blueprints, 44 material grids | lanes P0 to P4: the Havok shapes as fixed colliders, the body, bolts and ragdolls, the vehicles' physics (after lane V), surfaces. Lane V imports no collision; phase 2's hurtbox maps become P1's. |
| PR #812, the Battlefront game from the export | the gameplay records: modes, classes, weapons, abilities, Battle Points, bots | a new world on the real maps (`/battlefront`), not a retrofit of the galaxy surface's assault; the asset adapter contract reads this page's catalogue and packs. |
| PR #819, the galaxy's engine | three's node renderer, its lighting and Rapier; no new engine | lanes R, P, T, M: the light stack, the physics, the surface and map ports. |

What stays this page's: phase 0 (the tools, merged), phase 1 (the heroes on the game's skeleton, the packs, the loader, the hilts), phase 2 (everyone the game has, people and droids and beasts), lane S (the streaming, merged on #798's mirror), lane V (the vehicles' models, rigs, packs, cockpits and far cuts), lane F's effects (not its lighting), and the inventory. The check-in spawns no further world lanes; lane L does the worlds.

### 9. What this design does not do

- Does not touch nevarro, mandalore, sorgan, lothal or coruscant: nothing of theirs is in the 2017 game.
- Does not extract textures, clips or audio from the game itself; it takes what the uploader puts in the bucket, in the shape the manifest describes.
- Does not change the figure resolution order, `actors.js`, `placer.js`, `animator.js`, `clipLibrary.js` or the combat rules; `crew.js` gains one branch (a `rig: 'walrus'` row goes through the new loader), `gltf.js` and `textures.js` fetch through the pool, and the rest get better files under the same names.
- Does not build the classic edition's path: `battlefront-import.mjs` is that, when `bf2-extract` fills.
- Does not add a gate: the owner chose to deploy as today (answer 1).

## What the owner decides next

The questions this design had are answered above. What is left is the nod to write the plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-battlefront-2017-asset-pipeline.md`, phase 0 first (the tools, which need no textures), then phase 1 as soon as `web/textures/` holds the heroes' maps.

## Departures

Where phase 0’s code went another way than this page or its plan, one line each:

- The manifest’s `file` paths are relative to the bucket’s `web/` (`models/…glb`), not under it: `inBucket` in `scripts/lib/bf2017-paths.mjs` adds the prefix.
- The fetch’s and the URI parser’s tests are `bf2017-manifest.test.mjs` and `bf2017-paths.test.mjs`, not a `bf2017-fetch.test.mjs`; the fetch itself is the thin CLI over them.
- The fixture holds two 64² PNGs, not three: the colour map and the raw `_NAM` map, rebuilt from the unpacked `__normal` and `__orm` maps by the manifest’s own recipe, so the import test runs the recipe path (`ormPng`, `normalPng`); the import still writes three maps.
- `normalPng` rebuilds a normal’s z from x and y rather than setting B to 255, so a tilted normal keeps its length.
- `basisu -unpack` (1.16) writes no uncompressed level for a UASTC file; `unpackKtx2` keeps the BC7 level 0, near lossless from UASTC, always as RGBA, and the import reuses an unpack across cuts (about 9 s a 2048² map otherwise).
- A derived map is also taken from a PNG of itself (`<map>__normal.png`) when the uploader puts one there, before the recipe and the KTX2.
- Normals are WebP like the other maps, not KTX2 UASTC: the import test pins WebP; the KTX2 call is phase 9’s (ultra), where `scripts/ktx2.mjs report` can judge it per map.
- `--metres` defaults to the manifest’s own height (`--asis`); `--cuts` takes LOD numbers (`plain=2`); `--catalog`, `--credits` and `--unpacked` exist for the test’s sake.
- A short sequel-era name (`rey`, `finn`, `ep7`, `ep9`) is matched only between separators, so `grey` and `osprey` pass; the longer ones anywhere in a segment.
- The rig is kept in full with `--rig`: no prune, no rename (the owner, 2026-10-10: keep the physics and the rest so the game is accurate). The prune of section 3 was written and tried: Luke’s body lost its fingers and all 79 face bones, which its LOD2 mesh does not weight, and it was taken out. A part’s duplicate skeleton is still joined to the body’s (`scripts/lib/rig-parts.mjs`). The `grip` node goes under `Wep_Root`, else `IK_Joint_RightHand`, else at the origin, so every DICE name stays.
- The import does not take parts by full manifest name yet: phase 1 adds it.
