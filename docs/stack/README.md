# The stack

One page per library, engine or framework the site is built on, and this index of every package in `package.json`: its version, the page it belongs to, and how many files under `src/` and `scripts/` import it (tests left out). To add a dependency, give it a row in `PAGES` in `scripts/stack-census.mjs` and a page made from `_template.md`, then run `node scripts/stack-census.mjs --write`; the measure’s `stack-pages` fails until the package has a row here.

`three/webgpu` and `three/tsl` ship inside `three` and so have no row; their page is [webgpu-tsl.md](webgpu-tsl.md).

The table between the markers is written by `scripts/stack-census.mjs`; don’t edit it by hand. A package with no importing file here is still used: the test runner (tests are left out of the count), a command-line tool, a font read from CSS, a set of types, or a plugin a root config file loads.
