# Decisions

The record of choices the site has made, so the next session that asks “why not X?” finds the answer instead of a grep through the specs.

## The shape

- One file per decision: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, dated the day it was made.
- Four sections, in this order: **Context** (the question and what was measured), **Decision** (what was chosen, in a sentence or two), **Consequences** (what follows, good and bad), **Revisit when** (the facts that would reopen it).
- Under 80 lines. Link the spec that holds the long version rather than copying it.
- Never edited after a week. A change of mind is a new entry that links the old one; the old one stays as it was, so the record shows what was known when.
- Written when a session makes or touches a choice, not retroactively.
