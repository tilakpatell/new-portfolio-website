## Not CC0: made for this site

These live outside this folder and are not public domain.

- `../models/galaxy/surface/{theed,homestead,palace}.glb` (and their `.lod1.glb` light copies): buildings on the galaxy's worlds, generated for this site by Tilak Patel with Meshy AI (meshy.ai, a paid plan: the output is the site owner's), each from a real picture of the place (a film still or a production painting, lifted onto a plain background) or a concept image, or one of the owner's own Meshy models retextured. Made by `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings.mjs`; the Meshy task ids, and the Wookieepedia pictures each was made from, are in `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings-tasks.json`. Listed in `src/components/galaxy/surface/catalog/made.js`.
- `../models/galaxy/surface/{massassi,ewokhut,theedpalace,tipocadome,mining,citadel,wroshyrgreat,corutower}.glb` (and their `.lod1.glb` light copies where there is one): the same, for the filled worlds' checkpoint (the Great Temple, an Ewok hut, Theed's palace, a Tipoca City dome, the Mustafar mining facility, the Citadel tower, a great wroshyr and a Coruscant tower) by `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings.mjs` from `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings-fill.mjs`; the task ids and the Wookieepedia pictures are in `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings-fill-tasks.json` (the wroshyr's under `kachirho`, the picture it was made from). Listed in `src/components/galaxy/surface/catalog/made.js`.
- `../models/galaxy/surface/{nevarroarch,nevarrodome,lothtemple,lothdome,sundaridome,geohive}.glb` (and `sundaridome.lod1.glb`, `geohive.lod1.glb`): the same, made for the overhaul's back lane (the Outer Rim, Scarif, the core and forest worlds) by `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings.mjs` from `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings-back.mjs`; the task ids and the Wookieepedia pictures are in `scripts/meshy-galaxy-buildings-back-tasks.json`. Listed in `src/components/galaxy/surface/catalog/outer.js` and `clonewars.js`.
- `../models/metherria/{drum-base,drum-blue,hammer}.glb`: Walt's two chemical drums and his ball-peen hammer in Metherria, generated for this site by Tilak Patel with Meshy AI (meshy.ai, a paid plan: the output is the site owner's). Made by `scripts/meshy-albuquerque.mjs` (concept image, then a textured model, baked into the scene's frame with 1K WebP textures); the Meshy task ids are in `scripts/meshy-albuquerque-tasks.json`.
- `../models/albuquerque/<id>.glb`: Albuquerque's people (Walt and Jesse in hazmat, Metherria's customers, Hank, Hector and the nurse), generated for this site by Tilak Patel with Meshy AI in the same way, then rigged by Meshy: stylized figures described by look and costume, not likenesses of anyone real.
- `../models/albuquerque/world/<name>.glb`: the Albuquerque world's buildings and cars (Walt's house and his Aztek, Hank's SUV, Saul's office, Los Pollos Hermanos, the laundry over the superlab, Casa Tranquila, the A1A Car Wash, and the rest of town: the KiMo Theatre, the Dog House, the DEA's office, the Crossroads Motel, the house under Vamonos Pest's tent, Jesse's house, Loyola's diner and Hank and Marie's house), generated for this site by Tilak Patel with Meshy AI in the same way, baked to the ground with their longest side set to size. (`rv.glb` there is the first RV, no longer loaded: the town uses the Sketchfab one below.)
